<a name="f02">2. How do I determine if I have a valid credit card number?</a> 
</p> <p>
Credit cards use the Luhn Check Digit Algorithm.  The main purpose of
this algorithm is to catch data entry errors, but it does double duty
here as a weak security tool.
</p> <p>
For a card with an even number of digits, double every odd numbered
digit and subtract 9 if the product is greater than 9.  Add up all the
even digits as well as the doubled-odd digits, and the result must be
a multiple of 10 or it's not a valid card.  If the card has an odd
number of digits, perform the same addition doubling the even numbered
digits instead.

<a name="f03">3. What is the layout of data on magnetic stripe cards?</a>
</p> <p>
A standard card may have any of three tracks, or a combination of these
tracks.
</p> <p>
Track 1 was the first track standardized.  It was developed by the
International Air Transportation Association (IATA) and is still
reserved for their use.  It is 210 bpi with room for 79 characters.  It
includes the primary account number (up to 18 digits) and the name (up
to 26 alphanumeric characters).
</p> <p>
Track 2 was developed by the American Bankers Association (ABA) for
on-line fincancial transactions.  It is 75bpi with room for 40 numeric
characters.  It includes the account number (up to 19 digits).
</p> <p>
Track 3 is also used for financial transactions.  The difference is its
read/write ability.  It is 210bpi with room for 107 numeric digits.  It
includes an enciphered PIN, country code, currency units, amount
authorized, subsidiary account information and other restrictions.
</p> <p>
For more information, read the ANSI/ISO 7811/1-5 standard.  This
document is available from the American Bankers Association.

<a name="f04">4. What are the ethics of hacking?</a> 
</p> <p>
An excerpt from <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em> by Steven Levy:
</p> <pre>
Access to computers -- and anything which might teach you something
about the way the world works -- should be unlimited and total.
Always yield to the Hands-On imperative.

All information should be free.

Mistrust Authority.  Promote Decentralization.

Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as
degrees, age, race, or position.

You can create art and beauty on a computer.

Computers can change your life for the better.
