-=] Critical points to consider

1. Time management and the duration of the talks are one of the critical points in the Congress. 
Rather, they should ask for a longer talk than trying to rush twenty minutes, without allowing 
time for audience questions.

2. It will be appreciated EXCLUSIVE talks, which not previously published in any other forum, 
blog, website, event or conference.

3. We believe in the responsible Full-disclosure so, if the idea is to present a Zero-Day, we want confirmation from that has contacted the manufacturer / victim, if this contact has not been made, 
we offer to manage the contact.

4. A cause for termination of the relationship between the Speaker and RootedCON is to not deliver
of (every) material on the date indicated.

5. PLEASE, it's very important to * CLEARLY * indicate if accommodation and travel is needed or not 
when you submit your proposal, Rooted reserves the right not to meet such needs if it is not initially requested.
