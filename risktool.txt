              ALRAM (Automated Livermore Risk Analysis Methodology)

Methodology. Quantitative.  A government-developed system, this
methodology is structured to allow screening of asset/threat-event
combinations so that only high impact risks are reviewed.  The
methodology focuses attention on the effectiveness of proposed
security controls as well as those already in place.  ALRAM is divided
into three major phases to include project planning, risk analysis,
and decision support.  The initial phase defines the scope of the
analysis and identifies needed resources and personnel.  The second
phase collects and analyzes the data collected from phase 1.  In this
second phase, risk elements are identified by establishing
corresponding threats, control and asset components, the results of
which are provided as input for the final decision support phase.  The
final phase presents cost-benefit estimates for each proposed
safeguard along with a prioritization and selection scheme.

Remarks.
         ARES (Automated Risk Evaluation System) Version 1.1

Methodology.  Quantitative.  ARES uses a rule-based inference engine
and a menu-driven checklist system to perform a risk analysis in
support of a required accreditation.  Instead of a "number-based"
program, ARES collects data on the user (location, phone number,
address, etc.) with fill-in-the-blank screens.  Information pertaining
to the computer system's security and operating environments, along
with a wide range of other data, is gathered by checklists.  The data
collected includes the highest classification of the data on the sys-
tem; the clearance level of the system's user; the computer system's
level of trust; and topics as diverse as housekeeping practices,
password management, magnetic remanence, and others.  When producing
the final or interim reports, ARES compares the gathered checklist
responses against the rule base.  The resultant report consists of
cover sheet, approval letters, and a listing of potential risks to the
system with a documentation reference for each.  The report gives the
end-level computer security manager the option to accept or fix each
of the potential risks as part of the accreditation process.  The
report is written to an ASCII text file, allowing the manager to
tailor the final product to local procedures.

Program (CVRP).
               BDSS (Bayesian Decision Support System)

Methodology.  Quantitative/Qualitative.  BDSS is programmed to gather
tangible and intangible asset valuation data and to ask questions that
assess potential risks using quantitative data bases provided by the
vendor.  The user can include site-specific threat experiences which
the algorithms will process along with the quantitative knowledge
base.  Threats, vulnerabilities, asset categories, and selected
safeguards are automatically mapped and cross-mapped to each other. 
This system ranks threats before and after the implementation of
safeguards so that the representation of comparable exposure to loss
may be examined.  The analysis results are typically displayed
graphically with risk curves based on dollar loss values and
probability of loss coordinates.  The central algorithms of BDSS are
based on Bayes' Theorem addressing uncertainty and statistical
methods.  BDSS software produces a variety of printed reports as well
as ASCII files that may be exported to the user's word processor.
There is flexibility in how BDSS is used; for example, the vulner-
ability analysis feature of the BDSS application provides a stand-
alone qualitative presentation of safeguard system weaknesses.

                            BUDDY SYSTEM

Methodology.  Qualitative.  The Buddy System is an automated risk
analysis methodology for microcomputer environments and comprises two
components: (1) countermeasures survey and (2) security analysis and
management (SAM).  This software package assesses the level of
vulnerability based on safeguards already in place.  The level of
information being processed on the system determines whether or not
the assessed level of vulnerability is acceptable.  Recommendations
for corrective action are provided for each vulnerability that falls
outside of the acceptable range through the use of on-line "what if"
scenarios.  A data base containing over 100 safeguards is included in
this software package.  Further, the Risk Management component of the
system allows the analyst to track recommended corrective action
implementations for reports and/or follow-up procedures.

       CRAMM  (CCTA Risk Analysis and Management Methodology)

Methodology.  Qualitative.  CRAMM is a formalized security risk
analysis and management methodology developed by the British
government and BIS Applied Systems Limited.  CRAMM is composed  of
three stages each supported by questionnaires and guidelines.  Stage 1
performs a valuation of the assets of the system or network under
review.  Qualitative values are determined for the data assets on a
scale of 1 to 10, for the potential impacts of disclosure, modifi-
cation, unavailability, and destruction.  The physical assets are
first valued on the basis of replacement or reconstruction costs which
are converted to a scale of 1 to 10, Where asset values are low (3 or
below) the system under review is likely only to require a baseline
level of protection and the review moves to Stage 3.  Stage 2 assesses
the threats and vulnerabilities of each asset group and ranks the
threat/vulnerability pair on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 reflects a
worst-case scenario.  Stage 3 is concerned with safeguard selection
referring to a `library' of over 900.  To aid management in deciding
upon the most appropriate safeguard, CRAMM provides a facility to
explore options.  A range of management reports are available.
     The CRAMM software also provides a password system to reduce the
risk of unauthorized access to the data that is being analyzed.
Sensitivity markings are provided on all screens and hardcopy output.

Methodology.  Quantitative/Qualitative.  This product uses the concept
of annualized loss expectancy (ALE) to quantify the criticality of
risk exposure for applications.  The software collects information
about each application's loss potential, optimum off-site recovery,
cost of backup, cost to recover.  It uses this information to
calculate each application's annualized risk potential.  The
criticality of each application is determined by the potential for
loss caused by a processing interruption and a profile of up to 14
delay factors.  The user interacts with the system by means of screens
which display information about the risk exposure.  Once the user has
reviewed the initial results, "what if" analysis may be performed by
modifying the input data as a way of verifying the effectiveness of
certain safeguards.  The information contained in the output reports
may be used to optimize contingency plans.  The ALE, as a function of
maximum outage duration, is compared with the corresponding cost of
backup data to identify automatically the optimum off-site recovery
site.

Remarks.                       GRA/SYS

Methodology.  Qualitative.  GRA/SYS is a tool designed to assist
internal auditors and security personnel in developing a work priori-
tization plan for reviewing organizational risks.  Specifically, the
software prepares an applications and computer activity inventory,
determines the number of risks  for several major control areas.  A
risk score that reflects the measure of risk to the organization is
calculated and prioritized in descending order on a scale of 1 to 9,
with 9 representing a worst-case situation.  An additional report that
reflects the number of times each risk occurs is also prepared.  Using
the output reports from this software package, the user is able to
identify those risks where more effective safeguards are needed.

                              IST/RAMP
(International Security Technology/Risk Analysis Management Program)

Methodology.  Quantitative.  IST/RAMP is a mainframe-resident risk
analysis program with an input module that is PC-resident.  The
software calculates the annualized loss expectancy and as well as
single occurrence loss.  The system can also provide a qualitative
analysis.  IST/RAMP generates data collection forms to assist the risk
analyst in organizing and controlling data collection.  Five loss
categories are addressed: service interruptions; physical loss and
damage; fraud; unauthorized disclosure; and physical theft.  A library
of data bases enables the analyst to maintain an audit trail of input
data changes.  A 'what-if' capability enables the analyst to select
the most cost-effective security measures.  
     RAMP<->LINK is a PC-resident, menu-driven data entry system which
uses risk information entered by the analyst to build a DOS file that
can be uploaded to IST/RAMP for processing.

Jacobson, (212) 288-3101

Remarks.  RAMP<->LINK makes it unnecessary for the analyst to be
familiar with the details of IST/RAMP data entry formats.  The analyst
enters the data off-line and logs onto a mainframe where IST/RAMP is
resident using any communications software package that has a "file
send" command.
                               JANBER

Methodology.  Qualitative.  Janber initiates a yes/no questionnaire
and checklist for collecting information about existing security
controls.  The software weights in place safeguards and measures them
against the classification level of data being processed on the
system.  These data classification levels go from highly sensitive but
unclassified information to highly classified data.  The analysis
provides a linguistic characterization of the level of vulnerability
from 2-28, with 28 representing a worst-case scenario.  Vulner-
abilities, safeguards and their weights can be preestablished by the
vendor to meet the organization's requirements.  Safeguards that are
required, but not implemented, are flagged in a report and recom-
mended as meeting organizational guidelines and directives provided.
Users have the capability of performing "what-if" scenarios to
evaluate the effectiveness of certain safeguards.
     The Janber application allows users to define standard entries
for specific data fields.  The results of the data collection and
analysis are maintained on separate data bases.  The developer
recommends that the analysis and the data collection be performed by
different personnel to assure the integrity of the results.  The
developer further recommends that the analysis be performed by
computer security professionals to achieve optimum results.  The
software provides a faculty to track action items resulting from the
evaluation. 
     Janber creates a database of information on all systems surveyed
and provides a data base query capability for contingency planning and
recovery operations.

Methodology. Qualitative/Quantitative.  LAVA administers
questionnaires which results in the identification of missing safe-
guards in 34 areas ranging from password management to personnel
security and internal audit practices.  The software evaluates
potential consequences and impact upon the organization and the
ultimate loss exposure (risks).  LAVA considers three kinds of
threats: natural and environmental hazards, accidental and intentional
on-site human threats (including the authorized insider), and off-
site human threats.  Detailed LAVA reports provide  qualitative and
quantitative results of the risks identified.  












Hardware Requirements.

Developer/Vendor.  Suzanne Smith, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los
Alamos, NM;  (505) 667-7777.

Remarks. The LAVA methodology stresses a team approach for conducting
the risk assessment.  The team should be composed of people with a
broad spectrum of backgrounds and expertise to ensure a thorough
assessment.  It is recommended that a consensus among the group be
reached before entering an answer to any of the questions and, in some
cases, this may be the most difficult part of administering this risk
management software. 
                               MARION

Methodology. Qualitative/Quantitative.  MARION assesses business risks
associated with information systems drawing on a large database of
actual incidents.  The software incorporates a questionnaire to
evaluate the level of security that is currently being applied within
the organization.  Each question is allocated a weighting which
reflects the relative importance according to the analysis of the
underlying database of events.  A score is allocated for each question
and the responses and the scores are stored.  The software calculates
the overall score for each of 27 categories of security and presents
the results graphically and in printed form.  Once the current
security profile has been determined, the software will compare each
category with industry norms  which are derived from the database. 
The software uses the information on costs also held in the database
to calculate an estimated expenditure in relation to the total
security budget.  The calculated costs are analyzed according to the
nature of the security category and presented graphically in detailed
tables.  A "what-if" capability allows one to use different budgets to
determine the effects on the security profile.  The effects of the
proposed measures can also be displayed.

                              MINIRISK

Methodology.  Qualitative.   MINIRISK is a tool designed to assess
computer security vulnerabilities in a micro computer environment.  A
vulnerability assessment questionnaire allows the organization to
evaluate the adequacy and completeness of individual safeguards areas
and to reevaluate these same areas after missing safeguards have been
implemented.  During the process of answering the MINIRISK
questionnaire, the user identifies missing safeguards in 10 to 50
vulnerability categories ranging from password management to
contingency planning and internal audit controls.  Safeguards and
controls considered mandatory by the organization have been appointed
for each category that is to be reviewed.  The absence of certain
safeguards determines the level of vulnerability on a scale of zero to
9, with zero being the best case, and 9 the worse.  MINIRISK
establishes a threshold by which to evaluate vulnerabilities that
exceed an acceptable risk level.

Remarks. Government agencies may obtain copies of this software at no
cost.                          RANK-IT

Methodology.  Quantitative.  RANK-IT is a risk assessment software
package that uses the Delphi technique.  Delphi is an expert system
approach to risk ranking.  This software automates the Delphi
technique by adding Comparison Risk Ranking to obtain an ordinally
ranked list of the items being ranked or to calculate percentage risk
values.  Each ranked item has a numerical value that can be used as a
weighting factor or a cardinal number value.
     RANK-IT is used to risk rank system threats, controls, vulner-
abilities, components, or any other criteria.  It also can be used to
rank other types of business decision alternatives, whether
quantifiable or not.

                              RiskCALC

Methodology.  Quantitative.  An annual loss expectancy (ALE) or other
metric is computed based on an answered questionnaire.  The user may
optionally change the values of RiskCALC variables to determine the
most cost-effective safeguards and display the results on the user's
screen.  RiskCALC is part of a `family' of software tools described
below.  They each provide a standard ASCII file interface for
exporting and importing RiskCALC variables. 

     o    RiskCALC allows the user to answer questions and print
          reports into which values elicited from the questionnaire
          are automatically inserted.

     o    Risk Minimizer identifies an organization's most significant
          risks from a completed analysis.  Risk Minimizer may be used
          with other risk management software tools that use the
          RiskCalc file format.  

     o    System Manager assists in designing or customizing an
          existing risk analysis model.  

     o    Demonstration Models allow the user to develop a site-
          specific questionnaire or select one that models several
          risk scenarios.

Remarks                        RISKPAC

Methodology.  Qualitative/Quantitative.  RiskPAC is a knowledge-based
system that uses a questionnaire metaphor to interact with the user
and measure risk in government-related and other topics.  The user's
answers to a questionnaire are stored in separate files called
surveys.  Different surveys are compared to determine the results of
corrective measures, or to perform "what-if" analyses.  Questions in a
questionnaire are grouped into categories, similar to a book divided
into chapters.  Each category is scored separately, providing a
detailed and logical analysis of a subject.  RiskPAC's reports feature
the level of risk for each category.  Based on the score for each
category, RiskPAC provides recommendations for corrective actions (a
database of corrective actions is included in each questionnaire).
     RiskPAC also includes a quantitative analysis module, the A.L.E. 
Calculator, an annualized loss exposure (A.L.E.) analysis.  Multiple
A.L.E. work-sheets can be created.  Lists of asset and threat
descriptions stored in separate files can be loaded into worksheets,
reducing data entry and supporting "what-if" analysis.  Pop-up lists
on the worksheet include data assets, threats to assets, dollar
impact, and frequency of events.  A.L.E. values are calculated as the
user works.
     The RiskPAC System Manager program (available separately) is used
to create or modify questionnaires.  RiskPAC System Manager allows the
user to enter a set of questions, responses, and corrective actions,
and turn them into an expert system for risk assessment.

Hardware Requirements.

- IBM PC/XT, AT, PS/2 or 100% compatible computer.
- 640K of RAM, hard disk drive.

                              RISKWATCH

Methodology.  Qualitative/Quantitative.  RISKWATCH is a security
management tool consisting of seven modules.  Module 1 is a risk
analysis tool which conducts a formal risk analysis of ADP Centers,
applications, networks, or remote areas; Module 2 supports on-going
risk management planning; Module 3 develops a security plan; Module 4
develops contingency plans and Module 5 conducts a Security Test and
Evaluation (ST&E) of selected safeguards.  Module 6 is a graphics
program and Module 7 is an Expert System Development Tool.  RISKWATCH
includes a questionnaire development tool which allows questions to be
added or modified.  The modules can be purchased separately.  
     RISKWATCH has a built-in expert knowledge base to aid in-house
security expertise.  It has report capabilities, including a text
finder, and a graphics program to translate risk analysis results into
bar graphs or pie charts.  No other software is required.  RISKWATCH
is designed to meet all Federal agency requirements for Risk Analysis,
including OMB A-130.  It automatically determines the implementation
of safeguards, with a Return on Investment ratio for each safeguard.
     RISKWATCH can create questionnaire diskettes for distribution, or
information can be gathered electronically through a network config-
uration.  A vulnerability assessment is automatically created for each
remote site.  Audit trails are maintained throughout the program.
     New releases are available once a year.

Methodology.  Qualitative/Quantitative.  SOS is a tool designed for
risk and security management of a system.  The user begins by defining
the system identification in the database dictionary.  Using this
database, a quick risk assessment is done to determine dollar exposure
of loss or unauthorized modification of system data.  The user can
then use a pre-defined or user-designed questionnaire for self-
assessment, data security review or system audit.  With this infor-
mation, the user then develops a database of threats, vulnerabilities
and safeguards that can be used in writing a contingency plan. 
     SOS's approach allows for mapping where application data resides
and the level of risk for PCs, applications, LANs, data
communications, data base systems, data centers, operating systems,
security products, systems under development and hardware.
