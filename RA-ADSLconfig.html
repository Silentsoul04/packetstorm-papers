<U>Folow ups:</U> There are a few ways of connecting to the
ADSL modem that I am aware of.  
<UL>
 <LI>The first way is by MAC(Media Access Control) Address Identification.
First of all a MAC Address is an address specific to each particular
ethernet card that is made.
  The way this service works is that the ISP(Internet Service Provider)
will take the MAC Address from your ethernet card and call down to the
station
 where they will lock that MAC Address into a database.  This database
will then only allow this MAC Address on this particular card connect
through the
 ADSL modem.  So to allow for more than one computer to connect through
this ADSL modem you will have to purchase a hub, and separate ethernet
cards for
 each aditional computer you wish to have on the internet.  You will now
have to get some sort of proxy software or setup a UNIX router.  This
service can
 use <U>DHCP</U> or <U>Static</U> IP Addressing.  You can setup either of
these in linux with almost no trouble at all.  You do need the primary and
secondary DNS.
 your hostname, and static IP address information.
 <LI>My ISP does not use MAC Address Identification.  It uses DHCP and
allows 3 users to connect to the ADSL modem at one time.  The only down
side is that
 you have to run their software which makes it unusable in linux or any
other OS unless you or the ISP make the program specifically.  In either
case it requires
 specific knowledge of what you are doing.  And you will still have to buy
the hub and the extra ethernet cards for each extra computer that you want
to be able
 to access the internet.
 <LI>Either way for Windows or Linux you are going to have to have TCP/IP
enabled to get on the internet.

Address's & MAC Address's
<UL>
 <LI><U>Linux:</U> In the console type "ifconfig" it should bring up 2
devices eth0 (your ethernet card) and lo (your local loopback) and display
MAC Address and IP information.
 <LI><U>Windows:</U> Click on the Start Menu and go to Run.. now type
"winipcfg".  You should be able to get all the information you need and
more from this program.

 <LI><U>Linux:</U> In the console type "ifconfig" it should bring up 2
devices eth0 (your ethernet card) and lo (your local loopback).  If these
both show up you should be able to access the internet,
 if not then try reinstalling the ethernet card.
 Now you have to got to the control panel and set the connection on the
ethernet card (eth0) to connect via DHCP or specify the Static IP address
information.
 <LI><U>Windows:</U> Boot into windows and right click on network
neighborhood.  Go down to the properties section.  Once there make sure
that in the configuration tab that TCP/IP is there if not add it.  Now
reboot.
  Once back in Windows either run the software if your ISP gives you any
or you are most likely online already.

 <LI>I assume all the contract work has been done in order to use your
ADSL modem (eg: the ADSL people have come to install the spliter and
anything else you might need).
 <LI>You first need to have a working ethernet(Network Interface Card)
card.  And your computer must be configured for what type of ADSL
connection you will be using.
 <LI>When this is done you should shut down your computer.  Now turn the
ADSL modem on and wait for the sync light to turn green.  If it does not
there is a wiring problem
 so call the contractors and yell at them.  If it turns green like it
should then you can boot your computer and when you restart you should be
online.  Or run the software
 provided by the ISP once the computer has booted into Windows.

 <LI>Be aware that most ISP's do not support Linux or any other flavor of
UNIX.  Just a thought when your looking for Tech. Support for your ADSL in
Linux.
 <LI>I have had many problems when using more than one of the same brand
name ethernet cards in one machine.  I would recomend 2 different brands.

Service</B></FONT></LEFT>
<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="4">
<UL>
 <LI><U>ISP Specified:</U> To network the ADSL modem to other computer you
will need a hub with an uplink jack and a few extra ethernet cables
depending on how many computers you want networked.  
Now once you have this done connect the ADSL modem into the uplink jack.
Now take some extra ethernet cable and plug it into jack 1 of the hub and
connect it to your ethernet card on your computer.  
You should be able to access the internet the same way as before just run
the software.
 <LI><U>MAC Address:</U> Networking with this type of connection is almost
the same but does have some technicalities.  To share the Internet
connection with this type of connectio you will need and extra
 ethernet card for the main(server) computer, ethernet cable, a hub with
uplink, and some proxy software or a router.  Now plug the ADSL modem into
one of the ethernet cards and take a peice of the ethernet cable
 and plug it from the second ethernet card into the uplink jack on the
hub.  Now setup the proxy information and hook up the other client
computers to the hub and they should work through the proxy conectivity.

 <LI>I have made my own file with my own knowledge and that of others on MAC address's on how to 
  clone them and on general information about them.  If you are interested on this topic please
  send me and email at odarkforce@hotmail.com and tell me what you think.  If you have any 
  extra information on cloning MAC Address's the information would be greatfull.  I would
  especially like to speak with someone who has cloned a MAC Address before and knows how
  to do this.  I strive to learn more about this topic so any information will be helpful.
