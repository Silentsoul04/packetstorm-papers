                                 -- + --

               The US have the NSA, hackers have the NSC.


--[ Synopsis:

The first edition of the NoSuchCon conference will take place in Paris
from the 15 to the 17 May of 2013.

NSC is the badass hardcore technical security conference. Of death.


--[ Background:

NoSuchCon (NSC) is a fork (think continuation) from the Hackito Ergo Sum
conference.

When you participate to some given open source software, if you submit 
patches, and if the project owner doesn't accept your contribution, you could
fork from it. Long story short : that's exactly what happened inside the
Hackito team. So most of the team left Hackito and started a new conference now
called No Such Conference. Sadly, we forked mostly over ego problems, that are
typical of human beings ;(

In real life, the NSC conference is organized by a (French) non profit
organization called No Such Association.


--[ Venue:

The NSC conference will be hosted in the amazing headquarters of the French
Communist Party. This astonishing building was designed by the recently deceased Brazilian
architect Oscar Niemeyer.

The address is:
Espace Oscar Niemeyer - Siege du Parti Communiste
2 Place Colonel Fabien, 75019 Paris, France


--[ Quality:

The aim of NSC is best summarized in 3 words : quality, quality and research.
That, and hard work !

We believe there is a place for quality independent security research
disclosure. We think that place should be run on a non profit basis.
We do our best to ensure that the chosen talks are of the upmost quality
thanks to the highly respected security researchers who form our selection
panel.

As a result, we hope to deliver in a 3 days single track conference some
seriously disruptive food for thoughts to security enthusiasts.

Wether you will then like a given talk or not depends on several factors
involving your personal interests... and your general appetite for security ;)

That being said, we totally think that every talk selected for NSC deserves the
attention of the entire audience, and we therefore do stick to a single track
format. That's a form of respect for speakers.

As a speaker, it doesn't mean you have to lower the bar of your talk. Rather
the opposite, this is intended to cut down the number of "fillers"; not-so-sexy
-talks. We actually encourage highly technical talks, and writing code is
somewhat compulsory (...unless you are better at solder ironing and have an
electronic solver !). Don't assume ridiculous prerequisites, but assume people
grasp new concepts quickly (isn't that what hacking is all about really ?).


--[ Disclosure policy:

We consider researchers as outstanding grown adults. We therefore impose them
the following disclosure policy: DO WHAT YOU WANT.


--[ Submitting:

We are interested in world domination 2013. We are glad you are willing
to contribute.

We highly encourage and will favour presentations with demos.

To assess the depth, novelty and relevance of submitted talks, we will
require a 3 to 4 pages whitepaper (as an order of magnitude..) along with your
submission. We know it's a lot of work for speakers, but we'll help you getting
in Paris : it's not too bad a deal ;)

We are accepting submissions in English only.

The standard format will be of 35 mins presentation + 10 mins Q&A.

If your talk deserves more time, feel free to ask two slots (that is extended
talk: 80min + 10mins Q&A).

Please note that talks with content will judged commercial or non vendor neutral
will be rejected and/or interrupted on stage.


General topics of interest are mostly offensive and include:

- Security problems that are not fixable,
- finding vulnerabilities and/or proving security properties of software,
- new exploitation techniques (new classes of bugs, heap overflows on
  different memory allocators, win8...), proving things on binaries,
- bytecode vulnerability discovery and exploitation (java, .NET, python...),
- reverse engineering, writing debuggers,
- exploit automation (targeted/worms),
- malware engineering,
- security assessment of new network protocols,
- hardware hacking (raspberry based automated network hacking ?),
- routers hacking,
- crypto: practical assessment of software, quantum computers, FPGA and
  hardware implementations,
- BYOD for dummies: ARM/x86 android/IOS hacking, persistence, remote control...
- Botnets, Exploit kits and how to use them for targeted attacks,
- Anti forensics: Piercing network firewalls and proxies, persistence,automated
  network ripping, data exfiltration, hiding your data from the CIA,
- owning corporate and government networks for ever,
- defeating new security protections,
- breaking our of hypervizors,
- hardware level vulnerabilities (cpu bugs ?),
- Hacking UEFI & Secure Boot (Bootkitting EUFI, Bitlocker...),
- Gnu Radio/SDR/anykindofwireless hacking, Signal Processing,
- Hacking web application frameworks (java, ruby, php, .NET,...),
- Be god on the internet, walk on water,
- break stuff.

We highly encourage any hardcore technical topics not listed in the above !!

--[ Deadlines:

The CFP closes the 31 of March 2013. The earlier you submit, the better for
all of us ;)

You shall be notified of your acceptance as a speaker by the 15th of April
2013.


--[ Do I want to talk there anyway ?
It's up to you mate. If you like the same things as us, you may as well like
the conference. You may want to have a look at the 3 previous editions of HES
we co-organized and see if it looks like something of interest.

We absolutely do encourage you to submit if you have something interesting to
say. In particular, academic researchers, hobbyists, or just regular security
enthusiasts of any age and from all over the internet are welcome to submit.


--[ Speaker benefits:
4 nights accommodation in Paris,
travel reimbursement (up to 1000$),
Much respect and love.

--[ Greetings:
The No Such Association (NSA) team would like thank the security research
community for its continuous support. We would like in particular to thank
the members of the Programming Committee, the past speakers, all of the
volonteers as well as all the attendees and the past sponsors, plus the
countless friends, that allowed Hackito to present some quality content,
at an affordable price, in an amazing environment. We owe you to do more
of all of that, but in a more transparent way. This is why we have created
the NSA and subsequently the NSC conference as a mean to ensure our conference
remains transparent and non profit, by law.


--[ Call for Artists:
We need new backgrounds, new logos, new banners... : feel free to submit your
art under the creative common license to art@nosuchcon.org
