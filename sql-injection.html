<span class=description>SQL Injection Attacks by Example</span>
<br clear="all">
<hr>


A customer asked that we check out his intranet site, which was used
by the company's employees and customers. This was part of a
larger security review, and though we'd not actually used SQL injection to
penetrate a network before, we were pretty familiar with the general concepts.
We were completely successful in this engagement, and wanted to recount
the steps taken as an illustration.

<p>
"SQL Injection" is subset of the an unverified/unsanitized user input
vulnerability ("buffer overflows" are a different subset), and the idea
is to convince the application to run SQL code that was not intended.
If the application is creating SQL strings naively on the fly and then
running them, it's straightforward to create some real surprises.

<p>
We'll note that this was a somewhat winding road with more than one wrong
turn, and others with more experience will certainly have different --
and better -- approaches. But the fact that we were successful does
suggest that we were not entirely misguided.

<p>
There have been other papers on SQL injection, including some that
are much more detailed, but this one shows the rationale of <b>discovery</b>
as much as the process of <b>exploitation</b>.

<h2><img src="../images/redbrick.gif" VALIGN="middle" width="6" height="14" alt="*"> The Target Intranet</h2>

<p>
This appeared to be an entirely custom application, and we had no
prior knowledge of the application nor access to the source code:
this was a "blind" attack.
A bit of poking showed that this server ran Microsoft's IIS 6 along
with ASP.NET, and this suggested that the database was Microsoft's
SQL server: we believe that these techniques can apply to nearly
any web application backed by any SQL server.

<p>
The login page had a traditional username-and-password form, but also an
email-me-my-password link; the latter proved to be the downfall of the
whole system.

<p>
When entering an email address, the system presumably looked in the
user database for that email address, and mailed something to that
address. Since <b>my</b> email address is not found, it wasn't going to
send <b>me</b> anything.

<p>
So the first test in any SQL-ish form is to enter a single quote as
part of the data: the intention is to see if they construct an SQL string
literally without sanitizing. When submitting the form with a quote in the
email address, we get a 500 error (server failure), and this suggests
that the "broken" input is actually being parsed literally. Bingo.

<p>
We speculate that the underlying SQL code looks something like this:

<blockquote><pre>
SELECT <i>fieldlist</i>
  FROM <i>table</i>
 WHERE <i>field</i> = '<span class="snip">$EMAIL</span>';
</pre></blockquote>

Here, <span class="snip">$EMAIL</span>
is the address submitted on the form by the user, and the larger query
provides the quotation marks that set it off as a literal string.
We don't know the specific <i>names</i> of the fields or table involved,
but we do know their <i>nature</i>, and we'll make some good guesses later.

<p>
When we enter <span class="snip">steve@unixwiz.net'</span>
- note the closing quote mark - this yields constructed SQL:

<blockquote><pre>
SELECT <i>fieldlist</i>
  FROM <i>table</i>
 WHERE <i>field</i> = '<span class="snip">steve@unixwiz.net'</span>';
</pre></blockquote>

when this is executed, the SQL parser find the extra quote mark and
aborts with a syntax error. How this manifests itself to the user depends
on the application's internal error-recovery procedures, but it's usually
different from "email address is unknown". This error response is a dead
giveaway that user input is not being sanitized properly and that
the application is ripe for exploitation.

<p>
Since the data we're filling in appears to be in the <b>WHERE</b> clause,
let's change the nature of that clause <i>in an SQL legal way</i> and see
what happens. By entering <span class="snip">anything' OR 'x'='x</span>,
the resulting SQL is:

<blockquote><pre>
SELECT <i>fieldlist</i>
  FROM <i>table</i>
 WHERE <i>field</i> = '<span class="snip">anything' OR 'x'='x</span>';
</pre></blockquote>

Because the application is not really thinking about the query - merely
constructing a string - our use of quotes has turned a single-component
<b>WHERE</b> clause into a two-component one, and the <b>'x'='x'</b> clause is
<b>guaranteed to be true</b> no matter what the first clause is (there is
a better approach for this "always true" part that we'll touch on later).

<p>
But unlike the "real" query, which should return only a single item each
time, this version will essentially return every item in the members
database. The only way to find out what the application will do in this
circumstance is to try it. Doing so, we were greeted with:

<blockquote><hr />
Your login information has been mailed to <i>random.person@example.com</i>.
<hr /></blockquote>

Our best guess is that it's the <i>first</i> record returned by the query,
effectively an entry taken at random. This person really did get this
forgotten-password link via email, which will probably come as surprise
to him and may raise warning flags somewhere.

<p>
We now know that we're able to manipulate the query to our own ends,
though we still don't know much about the parts of it we cannot see.
But we <b>have</b> observed three different responses to our various
inputs:

<ul>
<li> "Your login information has been mailed to <i>email</i>"
<li> "We don't recognize your email address"
<li> Server error
</ul>

The first two are responses to well-formed SQL, while the latter is
for bad SQL: this distinction will be very useful when trying to
guess the structure of the query.

<h2><img src="../images/redbrick.gif" VALIGN="middle" width="6" height="14" alt="*"> Schema field mapping</h2>

The first steps are to guess some field names: we're reasonably sure
that the query includes "email address" and "password", and there
may be things like "US Mail address" or "userid" or "phone number".
We'd dearly love to perform a <b>SHOW TABLE</b>, but in addition to not
knowing the name of the table, there is no obvious vehicle to get the
output of this command routed to us.

<p>
So we'll do it in steps. In each case, we'll show the whole query as we
know it, with our own snippets shown specially.  We know that the tail
end of the query is a comparison with the email address, so let's guess
<b>email</b> as the name of the field:

<blockquote><pre>
SELECT <i>fieldlist</i>
  FROM <i>table</i>
 WHERE <i>field</i> = '<span class="snip">x' AND email IS NULL; --</span>';
</pre></blockquote>

The intent is to use a proposed field name (<b>email</b>) in the constructed
query and find out if the SQL is valid or not. We don't care
about matching the email address (which is why we use a dummy <b>'x'</b>),
and the <b>--</b> marks the start of an SQL comment. This is an effective
way to "consume" the final quote provided by application and not worry
about matching them.

<p>
If we get a server error, it means our SQL is malformed and a syntax
error was thrown: it's most likely due to a bad field name. If we get
any kind of valid response, we guessed the name correctly. This is the
case whether we get the "email unknown" or "password was sent" response.

<p>
Note, however, that we use the <b>AND</b> conjunction instead of <b>OR</b>:
this is intentional. In the SQL schema mapping phase, we're not really
concerned with guessing any particular email addresses, and we do not
want random users inundated with "here is your password" emails from
the application - this will surely raise suspicions to no good purpose.
By using the <b>AND</b> conjunction with an email address that couldn't
ever be valid, we're sure that the query will always return zero rows.

<p>
Submitting the above snippet indeed gave us the "email address
unknown" response, so now we know that the email address is stored
in a field <b>email</b>. If this hadn't worked, we'd have tried
<b>email_address</b> or <b>mail</b> or the like. This process will
involve quite a lot of guessing.

<p>
Next we'll guess some other obvious names: password, user ID, name,
and the like. These are all done one at a time, and anything other
than "server failure" means we guessed the name correctly.

<p>
<blockquote><pre>
SELECT <i>fieldlist</i>
  FROM <i>table</i>
 WHERE <b>email</b> = '<span class="snip">x' AND userid IS NULL; --</span>';
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

As a result of this process, we found several valid field names:

<ul>
<li> email
<li> passwd
<li> login_id
<li> full_name
</ul>

There are certainly more - we'll touch on this later - but a bit of
digging did not discover any. But we still don't know the name of the
<b>table</b> that these fields are found in - how to find out?

<h2><img src="../images/redbrick.gif" VALIGN="middle" width="6" height="14" alt="*"> Finding the table name</h2>

The application's built-in query already has the table name built into
it, but we don't know what that name is: there are several approaches
for finding that (and other) table names. The one we took was to rely
on a <b>subselect</b>.

<p>
A standalone query of

<blockquote><pre>
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <i>tabname</i>
</pre></blockquote>

Returns the number of records in that table, and of course
fails if the table name is unknown. We can build this into our
string to probe for the table name:

<blockquote><pre>
SELECT email, passwd, login_id, full_name
  FROM <i>table</i>
 WHERE <b>email</b> = '<span class="snip">x' AND 1=(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <i>tabname</i>); --</span>';
</pre></blockquote>

We don't care how many records are there, of course, only whether
the table name is valid or not. By iterating over several guesses,
we eventually determined that <b>members</b> was a valid table in
the database. But is it the table used in <b>this</b> query? For that
we need yet another test using <b>table</b>.<b>field</b> notation:
it only works for tables that are actually part of this query,
not merely that the table exists.

<blockquote><pre>
SELECT email, passwd, login_id, full_name
  FROM members
 WHERE email = '<span class="snip">x' AND members.email IS NULL; --</span>';
</pre></blockquote>

When this returned "Email unknown", it confirmed that our SQL was well
formed and that we had properly guessed the table name. This will be
important later, but we instead took a different approach in the interim.

<h2><img src="../images/redbrick.gif" VALIGN="middle" width="6" height="14" alt="*"> Finding some users</h2>

At this point we have a partial idea of the structure of the <b>members</b>
table, but we only know of one username: the random member who got our
initial "Here is your password" email. Recall that we never received
the message itself, only the address it was sent to. We'd like
to get some more names to work with, preferably those likely to have
access to more data.

<p>
The first place to start, of course, is the company's website to find
who is who: the "About us" or "Contact" pages often list who's running
the place. Many of these contain email addresses, but even those that
don't list them can give us some clues which allow us to find them
with our tool.

<p>
The idea is to submit a query that uses the <b>LIKE</b> clause, allowing
us to do partial matches of names or email addresses in the database,
each time triggering the "We sent your password" message and email.
<b>Warning</b>: though this reveals an email address each time we run
it, it also actually sends that email, which may raise suspicions.
This suggests that we take it easy.

<p>
We can do the query on email name or full name (or presumably other
information), each time putting in the <b>%</b> wildcards that <b>LIKE</b>
supports:

<blockquote><pre>
SELECT email, passwd, login_id, full_name
  FROM members
 WHERE email = '<span class="snip">x' OR full_name LIKE '%Bob%</span>';
</pre></blockquote>

Keep in mind that even though there may be more than one "Bob", we
only get to see one of them: this suggests refining our <b>LIKE</b>
clause narrowly.

<p>
Ultimately, we may only need one valid email address to leverage
our way in.

<h2><img src="../images/redbrick.gif" VALIGN="middle" width="6" height="14" alt="*"> Brute-force password guessing</h2>

One can certainly attempt brute-force guessing of passwords at the main
login page, but many systems make an effort to detect or even prevent
this. There could be logfiles, account lockouts, or other devices that
would substantially impede our efforts, but because of the non-sanitized
inputs, we have another avenue that is much less likely to be so protected.

<p>
We'll instead do actual password testing in our snippet by including
the email name and password directly. In our example, we'll use our
victim, <b>bob@example.com</b> and try multiple passwords.

<p>
<blockquote><pre>
SELECT email, passwd, login_id, full_name
  FROM members
 WHERE email = '<span class="snip">bob@example.com' AND passwd = 'hello123</span>';
</pre></blockquote>

This is clearly well-formed SQL, so we don't expect to see any server
errors, and we'll know we found the password when we receive the
"your password has been mailed to you" message. Our mark has
now been tipped off, but we do have his password.

<p>
This procedure can be automated with scripting in perl, and though we
were in the process of creating this script, we ended up going down
another road before actually trying it.

<h2><img src="../images/redbrick.gif" VALIGN="middle" width="6" height="14" alt="*"> The database isn't readonly</h2>

<p>
So far, we have done nothing but <b>query</b> the database, and even though
a <b>SELECT</b> is readonly, that doesn't mean that <b>SQL</b> is. SQL uses
the semicolon for statement termination, and if the input is not sanitized
properly, there may be nothing that prevents us from stringing our own
unrelated command at the end of the query.

The most drastic example is:

<p>
<blockquote><pre>
SELECT email, passwd, login_id, full_name
  FROM members
 WHERE email = '<span class="snip">x'; DROP TABLE members; --</span>';
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The first part provides a dummy email address -- <b>'x'</b> -- and we don't
care what this query returns: we're just getting it out of the way so we
can introduce an unrelated SQL command. This one attempts to drop (delete)
the entire <b>members</b> table, which really doesn't seem too sporting.

<p>
This shows that not only can we run separate SQL commands, but we
can also modify the database. This is promising.

<h2><img src="../images/redbrick.gif" VALIGN="middle" width="6" height="14" alt="*"> Adding a new member</h2>

Given that we know the partial structure of the <b>members</b> table,
it seems like a plausible approach to attempt adding a new record
to that table: if this works, we'll simply be able to login directly
with our newly-inserted credentials.

<p>
This, not surprisingly, takes a bit more SQL, and we've
wrapped it over several lines for ease of presentation,
but our part is still one contiguous string:

<blockquote><pre>
SELECT email, passwd, login_id, full_name
  FROM members
 WHERE email = '<span class="snip">x';</span>
        <span class="snip">INSERT INTO members ('email','passwd','login_id','full_name') </span>
        <span class="snip">VALUES ('steve@unixwiz.net','hello','steve','Steve Friedl');--</span>';
</pre></blockquote>

Even if we have actually gotten our field and table names right, several
things could get in our way of a successful attack:

<ol>
<li>We might not have enough room in the web form to enter this much
text directly (though this can be worked around via scripting, it's
much less convenient).

<li>The web application user might not have <b>INSERT</b> permission
on the <b>members</b> table.

<li>There are undoubtedly other fields in the <b>members</b> table,
and some may <i>require</i> initial values, causing the <b>INSERT</b> to
fail.

<li>Even if we manage to insert a new record, the application itself
might not behave well due to the auto-inserted NULL fields that we
didn't provide values for.

<li>A valid "member" might require not only a record in the <b>members</b>
table, but associated information in other tables (say, "accessrights"),
so adding to one table alone might not be sufficient.

</ol>

In the case at hand, we hit a roadblock on either #4 or #5 - we can't
really be sure -- because when going to the main login page and entering
in the above username + password, a server error was returned. This
suggests that fields we did not populate were vital, but nevertheless
not handled properly.

<p>
A possible approach here is attempting to guess the other fields, but
this promises to be a long and laborious process: though we may be
able to guess other "obvious" fields, it's very hard to imagine the
bigger-picture organization of this application.

<p>
We ended up going down a different road.

<h2><img src="../images/redbrick.gif" VALIGN="middle" width="6" height="14" alt="*"> Mail me a password</h2>

We then realized that though we are not able to add a new record to the
<b>members</b> database, we can <b>modify</b> an existing one, and this proved
to be the approach that gained us entry.

<p> From a previous step, we knew that <b>bob@example.com</b> had an account
on the system, and we used our SQL injection to update his database
record with <b>our</b> email address:

<blockquote><pre>
SELECT email, passwd, login_id, full_name
  FROM members
 WHERE email = '<span class="snip">x';</span>
      <span class="snip">UPDATE members</span>
      <span class="snip">SET email = 'steve@unixwiz.net'</span>
      <span class="snip">WHERE email = 'bob@example.com</span>';
</pre></blockquote>

After running this, we of course received the "we didn't know your
email address", but this was expected due to the dummy email
address provided. The <b>UPDATE</b> wouldn't have registered with
the application, so it executed quietly.

<p>
We then used the regular "I lost my password" link - with the
updated email address - and a minute later received this email:

<blockquote><pre>
From: system@example.com
To: steve@unixwiz.net
Subject: Intranet login

This email is in response to your request for your Intranet log in information.
Your User ID is: bob
Your password is: hello</pre>
</blockquote>

Now it was now just a matter of following the standard login process
to access the system as a high-ranked MIS staffer, and this was far
superior to a perhaps-limited user that we might have created with
our <b>INSERT</b> approach.

<p>
We found the intranet site to be quite comprehensive, and it included -
among other things - a list of all the users. It's a fair bet that many
Intranet sites also have accounts on the corporate Windows network, and
perhaps some of them have used the same password in both places. Since
it's clear that we have an easy way to retrieve any Intranet password,
and since we had located an open PPTP VPN port on the corporate firewall,
it should be straightforward to attempt this kind of access.

<p>
We had done a spot check on a few accounts without success, and we can't
really know whether it's "bad password" or "the Intranet account name
differs from the Windows account name". But we think that automated
tools could make some of this easier.

<h2><img src="../images/redbrick.gif" VALIGN="middle" width="6" height="14" alt="*"> Other Approaches</h2>

In this particular engagement, we obtained enough access that we did
not feel the need to do much more, but other steps could have been
taken. We'll touch on the ones that we can think of now, though we
are quite certain that this is not comprehensive.

<p>
We are also aware that not all approaches work with all databases,
and we can touch on some of them here.

<dl>
<dt><img src="../images/reddot.gif" width="6" height="6" alt="*" ALIGN="middle"> Use xp_cmdshell

<dd> Microsoft's SQL Server supports a stored procedure
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/tsqlref/ts_xp_aa-sz_4jxo.asp">xp_cmdshell </a>
that permits what amounts to arbitrary command execution, and if this
is permitted to the web user, complete compromise of the webserver is
inevitable.

<p>
What we had done so far was limited to the web application and
the underlying database, but if we can run commands, the webserver
itself cannot help but be compromised. Access to <b>xp_cmdshell</b>
is usually limited to administrative accounts, but it's possible
to grant it to lesser users.

<dt><img src="../images/reddot.gif" width="6" height="6" alt="*" ALIGN="middle"> Map out more database structure
<dd>Though this particular application provided such a rich
post-login environment that it didn't really seem necessary
to dig further, in other more limited environments this may
not have been sufficient.

<p>
Being able to systematically map out the available schema,
including tables and their field structure, can't help but
provide more avenues for compromise of the application.

<p>
One could probably gather more hints about the structure
from other aspects of the website (e.g., is there a "leave
a comment" page? Are there "support forums"?). Clearly,
this is highly dependent on the application and it relies
very much on making good guesses.

</dl>


<h2><img src="../images/redbrick.gif" VALIGN="middle" width="6" height="14" alt="*"> Mitigations</h2>

We believe that web application developers often simply do not think
about "surprise inputs", but security people do (including the bad guys),
so there are three broad approaches that can be applied here.

<dl>
<dt><img src="../images/reddot.gif" width="6" height="6" alt="*" ALIGN="middle"> Sanitize the input
<dd>It's absolutely vital to sanitize user inputs to insure that
they do not contain dangerous codes, whether to the SQL server
or to HTML itself. One's first idea is to strip out "bad stuff",
such as quotes or semicolons or escapes, but this is a misguided
attempt. Though it's easy to point out <b>some</b> dangerous characters,
it's harder to point to <b>all</b> of them.

The language of the web is full of special characters
and strange markup (including alternate ways of representing the
same characters), and efforts to authoritatively identify all
"bad stuff" are unlikely to be successful.

<p>
Instead, rather than "remove known bad data", it's better to
"remove everything but known good data": this distinction is
crucial.  Since - in our example - an email address can contain
only these characters:

<blockquote><pre>
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
0123456789
@.-_+
</pre></blockquote>

There is really no benefit in allowing characters that could
not be valid, and rejecting them early - presumably with an
error message - not only helps forestall SQL Injection, but
also catches mere typos early rather than stores them into
the database.

<blockquote><small>Sidebar on email addresses</small><hr />

It's important to note here that email addresses <i>in particular</i> are
troublesome to validate programmatically, because everybody seems to
have his own idea about what makes one "valid", and it's a shame
to exclude a good email address because it contains a character
you didn't think about.

<p>
The only real authority is
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html">RFC2822</a> (which
encompasses the more familiar RFC822), and it includes a fairly
expansive definition of what's allowed. The truly pedantic
may well wish to accept email addresses with ampersands and
asterisks (among other things) as valid, but others - including
this author - are satisfied with a reasonable subset that includes
"most" email addresses.

<p>
Those taking a more restrictive approach ought to be fully aware
of the consequences of excluding these addresses, especially
considering that better techniques (prepare/execute, stored
procedures) obviate the security concerns which those "odd"
characters present.
<hr /></blockquote>


There is really no benefit in allowing anything other than this even if
it ends up being "not dangerous". By keeping only known-good data,
whole ranges of "surprises" are avoided.

<p>
There is also a more subtle point here:
If some character really ought to be permitted in a field but you
have excluded them in error, you'll
hear about it from your users - this forms a natural feedback loop.
But if you permit data that should not be, the only way to find out
about it is during a security audit or when you find that your server
has been hacked.

<p>
This all suggests "err on the side of accepting less data".

<dt><img src="../images/reddot.gif" width="6" height="6" alt="*" ALIGN="middle"> Use bound parameters (the <b>PREPARE</b> statement)

<dd>Though sanitization is a good idea, it's still not quite
solving the problem because it means that you're relying on your
ability to properly counteract all the "bad stuff" that could be
found inside data. Though the email example is relatively easy
because the allowed character set is smaller, it gets a lot more
complicated for fields that must be allowed to contain these
"dangerous" characters.

<p>
The summary of a book, a comment from a user, or a recipe might all
be free-form fields where you simply cannot reasonably forbid use of a
single quote. The "sanitize" approach requires that you escape all the
data, which is hard to do in the face of a hostile user.

<p>
Vastly better is the use of <b>bound parameters</b>, which are supported
by essentially all database programming interfaces. In this technique,
an SQL statement string is created with placeholders - a question mark
for each parameter - and it's "compiled" ("prepared", in SQL parlance)
into an internal form.

<p>
Later, this prepared query is "executed" with a list of parameters:

<blockquote><small>an example in perl</small>:<hr /><pre>
$sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("SELECT email, userid FROM members WHERE email = <span class="snip">?</span>;");

$sth->execute(<span class="snip">$email</span>);
<hr /></pre></blockquote>

Here, <b>$email</b> is the data obtained from the user's form, and it
is passed as positional parameter #1 (the first question mark), and
at no point do the contents of this variable have anything to do
with SQL statement parsing. Quotes, semicolons, backslashes, SQL
comment notation - none of this has any impact, because it's
"just data". There simply is nothing to subvert, so the application
will be largely immune to SQL injection attacks.

<p>
There also may be some performance benefits if this prepared
query is reused multiple times (it only has to be parsed <i>once</i>),
but this is minor compared to the <b>enormous</b> security benefits.
This is probably the single most important step one can take to
secure a web application.

<dt><img src="../images/reddot.gif" width="6" height="6" alt="*" ALIGN="middle"> Limit database permissions and segregate users
<dd>
In the case at hand, we observed just two interactions that are made not
in the context of a logged-in user: "log in" and "send me password".
The web application ought to use a database connection with the most
limited rights possible: query-only access to the <b>members</b> table,
and no access to any other table.

<p>
The effect here is that even a "successful" SQL injection attack is
going to have much more limited success. Here, we'd not have been able
to do the <b>UPDATE</b> request that ultimately granted us access, so
we'd have had to resort to other avenues.

<p>
Once the web application determined that a set of valid credentials
had been passed via the login form, it would then switch that session
to a database connection with more rights.

<p>
It should go almost without saying that <b>sa</b> rights should <i>never</i>
be used for any web-based application.

<dt><img src="../images/reddot.gif" width="6" height="6" alt="*" ALIGN="middle"> Use stored procedures for database access
<dd>When the database server supports them, use stored procedures for
performing access on the application's behalf, which can
eliminate SQL entirely (assuming the stored procedures
themselves are written properly).

<p>
By encapsulating the rules for a certain action - query, update, delete,
etc. - into a single procedure, it can be tested and documented on a
standalone basis and business rules enforced (for instance, the
"add new order" procedure might reject that order if the customer
were over his credit limit).

<p>
For simple queries this might be only a minor benefit,
but as the operations become more complicated (or are used in more than
one place), having a single definition for the operation means it's
going to be more robust and easier to maintain.

<p>
<b>Note</b>: it's always possible to write a stored procedure that
itself constructs a query dynamically: this provides <b>no</b>
protection against SQL Injection - it's only proper binding
with prepare/execute or direct SQL statements with bound
variables that provide this protection.

<dd>Even having taken all these mitigation steps, it's nevertheless still
possible to miss something and leave the server open to compromise. One
ought to design the network infrastructure to <b>assume</b> that the bad
guy will have full administrator access to the machine, and then attempt
to limit how that can be leveraged to compromise other things.

<p>
For instance, putting the machine in a DMZ with extremely limited
pinholes "inside" the network means that even getting complete control
of the webserver doesn't automatically grant full access to everything
else. This won't stop everything, of course, but it makes it a lot harder.

<dt><img src="../images/reddot.gif" width="6" height="6" alt="*" ALIGN="middle"> Configure error reporting
<dd>The default error reporting for some frameworks includes
developer debugging information, and this <b>cannot</b> be shown
to outside users. Imagine how much easier a time it makes for
an attacker if the full query is shown, pointing to the syntax
error involved.

<p>
This information <i>is</i> useful to developers,
but it should be restricted - if possible - to just internal
users.

</dl>

Note that not all databases are configured the same way, and not all
even support the same dialect of SQL (the "S" stands for "Structured",
not "Standard"). For instance, most versions of MySQL do not support
subselects, nor do they usually allow multiple statements: these are
substantially complicating factors when attempting to penetrate a network.

<p>
We'd like to emphasize that though we chose the "Forgotten password"
link to attack in this particular case, it wasn't really because this
particular web application feature is dangerous. It was simply one of
several available features that might have been vulnerable, and it
would be a mistake to focus on the "Forgotten password" aspsect of
the presentation.

<p>
This Tech Tip has not been intended to provide comprehensive coverage on
SQL injection, or even a tutorial: it merely documents the process that
evolved over several hours during a contracted engagement.  We've seen
other papers on SQL injection discuss the technical background, but
still only provide the "money shot" that ultimately gained them access.

<p>
But that final statement required background knowledge to pull
off, and the process of <b>gathering</b> that information has merit too.
One doesn't always have access to source code for an application,
and the ability to attack a custom application blindly has some
value.
