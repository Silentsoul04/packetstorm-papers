|Title: Overloading a DSU Satellite |


Overloading a remote satellite 651 dsu/csu station
assuming the satellite is run using T1/FT1 Frame Relay
services

Exploiting outdail frq service

Line Rate
                  Internal or external clock; 1.544 Mbps +/- 50 bps.
                  When timing is derived from input signal: 1.544 Mbps +/-
                  200 bps.
                  Output line rate follows input line rate.

There are two methods of exploiting the service. One is being directly connected
and the other declining known digital FRQ's (frequencies)

The satellite's line code is AMI, B8ZS (B8ZS set as default) In order
to remotely modify this you need to establish a direct connection
to the satellite module.  Regardless of whether the connection is o
one that is idle
or accepted as a trusted affinity.  Using a binary overload routine by way of
terminal connection you can alter the line code two contrasted numeric
values.  This will cause the DSU connection to send out altered FRQ's
to other stations causing an over load in data.  The reason the data 
is able to manipulate the satellite in this manner is because the
satellite is accepting information that it cannot decipher.  So rather
than being deluged with jargon it shuts itself down. The time it takes
to throw the station offline depends on how many communicated systems
there are.


Terminal Binary method:

Input Level DS-1 from 0 dB to -27.5 dB âqÄ=ã]ÄÂ¯ã
¤aÄCã´eÄ;ã°Ãµ Â âqÄPer TR6241=ã]ÄÂ¯ã
âqÄ=ã]ÄÂ¯

If you are prompted with  "DSU:" tpye /DS-1 from 0 dB%per to -27.5 dB as
0 is default

Using T1/FT1 to overload DSU module:

You can run a remote loop back test by using
00.6000 as a default frq than running a
Data port loopback test via remote terminal
connection.  All you need is a #. They probably
won't figure how this happend so once they've
fixed things all you have to do is dailup
and do it again.
