Try going to one of those channels and see how long it takes until someone asks "where can I get a free shell account?" or "how do I hack Hotmail?").

ACK - Acknowledged (first, a little about the TCP protocol. When you want to send something from one computer to another using TCP you need to establish a connection first. The sender first sends a packet with the SYN flag on. On this point, the receiver can decide if he wants that packet. If a firewall is blocking the way or there is no daemon on the specific port the packet will be denied and the receiver will reply with a packet with the RST flag on. However, if the receiver wishes to accept the connection, he will reply with both SYN and ACK on, and then the sender should reply with ACK, which means he's ready to send. This whole thing is called a "TCP 3-Way Handshake" and it is good for transferring files which must not be corrupted, since there is no packet loss, and when something goes wrong the receiver can ask the sender to send that packet again. On UDP, you can't make sure the packet will ever get to the receiver but everything goes a lot faster that way. This is why Realplayer (www.real.com) uses UDP. This is why video and audio sometimes gets a little smudged on the way (just a little? Hehe...). But in case you want to transfer applications or games, you cannot afford to lose a single BIT, because if you would the program would probably get corrupted. In such cases, you have to use TCP, which is a bit slower but you don't have to worry about losing important pieces of information. More info at the entry TCP)

The only special thing about this trojan is that it is hidden within a "setup program". Both the server and the client are to be executed from Windows 95/98)

This is called a gateway. For those who remember the good old BBS days you might remember another type of gateway. Suppose you had a modem which was set to auto answer incoming calls. You could have programmed a gateway so whenever someone dials your number and your modem answers it will display a logo or give the person a menu etc'.)

IP - Internet Protocol (the connectionless, unreliable network protocol in the TCP/IP suite. It has two 32-bit header fields to hold address information. IP is also the busiest of all the TCP/IP protocols as almost all TCP/IP traffic is encapsulated in IP datagrams. IP's job is to route packets around the network. It provides no mechanism for reliability or accountability, for that, it relies on the upper layers. IP simply sends out datagrams and hopes they make it intact. If they don't, IP can try to send an ICMP error message back to the source, however this packet can get lost as well. IP has no means to guarantee delivery. Since IP is connectionless, it does not maintain any connection state information. Each IP datagram is sent out without regard to the last one or the next one. This, along with the fact that it is trivial to modify the IP stack to allow an arbitarily chosen IP address in the source (and destination) fields make IP easily subvertible)

MID/MIDI - Musical Instrument Digital Interface (a .mid file contains orders for the sound device to create notes. The music is devided into tracks where each track can have the soun of a different musical instrument, and all of the channels are played together. This way you can make channel one play the bass line as a bass guitar, channel two to be an organ, channel three to be an electric guitar, thus making your own music note by note, command by command. General MIDI files contain up to 10 tracks, extended MIDI files up to 16 tracks. Channel 10 is the standard for the beat (drums) channel. The result depends on your sound device. Sound Blaster 16, for example, would produce sounds similar to a PC BEEP (lol) for all instruments, while SOund Blaster AWE64 uses sound samples and the music it produces sounds very realistic. There are also applications that come with their own sound samples. MIDI files can also contain lyrics for programs that can show them, so you could host your own kareoke party!)

Connection-oriented simply means that the two hosts participating in a discussion must first establish a connection before data may change hands.  Reliability is provided in a number of means, but the two most important ones are data sequencing and acknowledgement. For acknowledgement, see the entry ACK. Now where were we? Oh, yeah, data sequencing. Since TCP is reliable, it must be able to recover from lost, duplicated, or out-of-order data. By assigning a sequence number to every byte transferred, and requiring an acknowledgement from the other end upon receipt, TCP can guarantee reliable delivery. The receiving end uses the sequence numbers to ensure proper ordering of the data and to eliminate duplicate data bytes. TCP sequence numbers can simply be thought of as 32-bit counters. They range from 0 to 4,294,967,295. Every byte of data exchanged across a TCP connection (along with certain flags) is sequenced. Now, how are sequence numbers set, you ask? Well, once a connection is starting to form (the first packet with the SYN flag on is sent), the sender of the SYN packet will set it's sequence number as an ISN - Initial Sequence Number. The next packet that will be sent will have the sequence number of ISN+1, etc'. The sequence number field in the TCP header will contain the sequence number of the *first* byte of data in the TCP segment. The acknowledgement number field in the TCP header holds the value of next *expected* sequence number, and also acknowledges *all* data up through this ACK number minus one. TCP uses the concept of window advertisement for flow control. It uses a sliding window to tell the other end how much data it can buffer. Since the window size is 16-bits a receiving TCP can advertise up to a maximum of 65535 bytes. Window advertisement can be thought of an advertisement from one TCP to the other of how high acceptable sequence numbers can be. Other TCP header flags of note are RST (reset), PSH (push) and FIN (finish).  If an RST is received, the connection is immediately torn down. RSTs are normally sent when one end receives a segment that just doesn't jive with current connection. The PSH flag tells the receiver to pass all the data is has queued to the aplication, as soon as possible.  The FIN flag is the way an application begins a graceful close of a connection (connection termination is a 4-way process). When one end receives a FIN, it ACKs it, and does not expect to receive any more data (sending is still possible, however))

This new law is being supported by such software giants as Microsoft, Adobe and WinPro. the proposed legislation is set to go before the National Conferences of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in July. If this panel approves this measure it will then be sent to state legislations around the country (good way to bypass the feds). Lucky us (Njan, F a n G and R a v e N), we live outside the US.

Data on the system is classified into one of four security classes, or "vaults" - INSIDE, OUTSIDE, SYSTEM and SYSTEM HIGH. The INSIDE vault generally contains the internet front end and any necessary CGI binaries, etc'. SYSTEm and SYSTEM HIGH are responsible for maintaining the external webpages and audit logs respectively. These vaults are totally segregated from each other and work essentially as seperate machines. If a program requires access to either of the vaults it must be authenticated by HP's Trusted Gateway Proxy daemon. The TGP daemon filters all requests from the internet and forwards the to middleware server packages that safely reside behind the INSIDE vault)
