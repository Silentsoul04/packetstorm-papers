This guideline, Volume 2 of 4 in the Procurement Guideline Series, is 

written to help facilitate the acquisition of trusted computer systems in 

accordance with DoD 5200.28-STD, Department of Defense Trusted Computer System 

Evaluation Criteria. It is designed for new or experienced automated 

information system developers, purchasers, or program managers who must 

identify and satisfy requirements associated with security-relevant 

acquisitions. Volume 2 addresses the way by which trusted computer system 

evaluation criteria are translated into language for use in the Request for 

Proposal Specifications and Statements of Work.<p>



Information contained within the Procurement Guideline Series will 

facilitate subsequent development of procurement guidance for the 

&quot;Federal Criteria.&quot;  This series also includes information being 

developed for certification and accreditation guidance.<p>



The business of computers, security, and acquisitions is complex and 

dynamic. As the Director, National Computer Security Center, I invite your 

recommendations for revision to this technical guideline. Our staff will 

work to keep this guideline current. However, experience of users in the field 

is the most important source of timely information. Please send comments and 

suggestions to:<p>

The National Security Agency (NSA) wants to clarify the computer security 

aspects of the Department of Defense (DoD) automated information system 

(AIS) acquisition process. Therefore, it is producing a four volume 

guideline series (referenced in Table 1 and more complete titles in the 

Bibliography). This document is the second volume. These guidelines are 

intended for Federal agency use in acquiring trusted systems.<p>

DoD Directive 5200.28, Security Requirements for Automated Information Systems 

(AISs), provides security requirements concerning all protection aspects of 

automated information systems. It specifies DoD 5200.28-STD, DoD Trusted 

Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), as the requirement source for 

trusted computer systems. The second page of DoD 5200.28-STD states: 

&quot;This document is used to provide a basis for specifying security 

requirements in acquisition specifications.&quot;<p>



<H3><A NAME="HDR1.2   3 8">1.2   PURPOSE</A></H3>



The intended user of the document is the &quot;procurement initiator,&quot; to 

include Program Managers, users, and security managers. These individuals must 

write the Request for Proposal (RFP), specifically Section C; and the 

Specification and Statement of Work (SOW). Volume 1 of this guideline series 

discusses the responsibilities of different roles in procurement initiation. 

<p>



The purpose of this document is to facilitate the contracting process, provide 

uniformity in competitive acquisitions, minimize procurement cost and risk, 

avoid delays in the solicitation process, and help ensure the solicitation 

is complete before its issuance.<p>



<H4><A NAME="HDR1.2.1   4 8">1.2.1   FACILITATING THE CONTRACTING PROCESS</

A></H4>



This guideline provides Specification and Statement of Work contract 

language to procure a trusted system, hopefully satisfied by a product from 

the NSA Evaluated Product List (EPL). (Note: The EPL is found in the 

Information Systems Security Products and Services Catalogue.) This 

guideline does not address Government certification and accreditation tasks. 

The guideline is written to ensure the selected system will provide adequate 

security, while avoiding a costly solution. This document has no intent beyond 

the security aspects of the system.<p>



DoD agencies should use this document whenever considering the acquisition 

of trusted computer systems. System security requirements are provided in 

contract language for direct incorporation into an RFP. The language 

duplicates the words and intent of the TCSEC.<p>



<H4><A NAME="HDR1.2.2   4 9">1.2.2   FACILITATING FAIRNESS IN COMPETITIVE 

ACQUISITION</A></H4>



The guidelines in this document support the procurement of EPL products and 

can only be implemented if the requirements for fair competition are 

satisfied. If these requirements have not been satisfied, the procurement 

can result in a protest and the selection may possibly be nullified. These 

requirements include:<p>



a. Public Law 98-369, &quot;Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.&quot;<p>



b. Title 41, United States Code, Section 418, &quot;Advocates for 

Competition.&quot;<p>



c. Title 10, United States Code, Section 2318, &quot;Advocates for 

Competition.&quot;<p>



d. DoD Instruction 5000.2, Defense Acquisition Management Policy, February 23, 

1991, pp. 5-A-2 through 4.<p>



e. DoD 5000.2-M, Defense Acquisition Management Documentation and Reports, 

February, 1991, p. 4-D-1-3 d.(1).<p>



<H4><A NAME="HDR1.2.3   4 9">1.2.3   MINIMIZING PROCUREMENT COST AND RISK</

A></H4>



Version 1 of this procurement guideline series is written solely to acquire 

products on the EPL, that is, to enable the procurement initiator to obtain 

those EPL products available for integration into an application, as opposed 

to developing a system through specification.<p>



For solutions that use EPL products, not only have the specifications of the 

evaluated Division/Class been satisfied, but the assurance tasks have been 

completed and the required documentation produced. Certification evidence, 

analyses, and operational documents previously produced for an NSA 

evaluation may be available to ensure trustworthiness and used directly for 

certification and satisfaction of required proposal and contract data. The 

results are less development risk and a lower overall cost to the bidder 

and, consequently, to the Government.<p>



For a defined entity of a system to be regarded as secure in the TCSEC sense 

means that, at a minimum, all of the requirements of some specified TCSEC 

Division/Class must be met. This is discussed further in Volume 1, Chapter 

3. To call that entity, for example, a Class B2 entity, would require NSA 

evaluation as a product satisfying the Class B2 criteria. (This convention has 

evolved over the past several years so that products would not be 

misrepresented in their evaluation status.)<p>



A successful certification evaluation of an entity (which has not been 

placed on the NSA EPL) can only state that evaluation and approval have been 

completed as part of a certification process against the Class B2 set of 

requirements.<p>



The rationale for this approach is as follows:<p>



a. Although a Division/Class of the TCSEC is used as the basis for the 

secure part of a system, the procurement and build process can introduce 

new, conflicting requirements and relax, reinterpret, or change the intent 

of some of the existing TCSEC requirements. Only an exact evaluation can 

determine this.<p>



b. The certification evaluation process addresses the needs of a single 

implementation. It has generally not experienced the finely honed expertise of 

the NSA evaluation process and personnel and does not have the same 

assurance for additional applications as does an EPL product.<p>



If there are fewer than five items on the EPL meeting the stated 

requirements (not just security requirements), the RFP will not dictate that 

an item come from the EPL. Also, the process for placement on the EPL is 

itself a restricted, Government controlled process. To state such a 

requirement in the RFP would constitute a discrimination against other vendors 

desiring to bid. It also cannot be stated that, for example, &quot;a B2 system 

is required&quot; because that implies the solution must be taken from the 

EPL. Therefore, the specific TCSEC requirements necessary to meet a certain 

Division/Class rating must be spelled out, without stating that the B2 product 

is desired. However, the desire for decreased risk and cost (common to EPL 

products) is normally a strong factor for source selection.<p>



<H4><A NAME="HDR1.2.4   4 10">1.2.4   ENSURING THE SOLICITATION IS COMPLETE 

BEFORE ISSUANCE</A></H4>



 If we try to use the TCSEC criteria as RFP requirements in existent form, 

it is found that those TCSEC criteria are not presented in the same form and 

order required by the RFP. The TCSEC mixes system specifications, work 

statements and products to be delivered. This guideline organizes the TCSEC 

requirements into an RFP format. <p>



<H3><A NAME="HDR1.3   3 10">1.3   SCOPE</A></H3>



This guideline reformates and reorders the requirements into a form suitable 

for use in contractual documents and does not revise the words in DoD 5200.28-

STD. This document might be thought of as an adaptation of the TCSEC for 

procurement. Procurement considerations are documented within the guideline to 

advise the procurement initiator of factors that may influence procurement 

decisions, including cost control. All of the factors are addressed as 

possible augmentations to the specification language provided. <p>



This set of four acquisition documents is not to be misunderstood as DoD 

policy when it comes to addressing the situation of acquiring complex 

systems composed of many heterogeneous components. The reason is that the 

DoD policy has not been finalized that addresses systems with combinations 

of EPL products and &quot;built and certified&quot; system entities, which may 

or may not use Division/Class criteria as requirements from DoD 5200.28-

STD.<p>



What will be required for more complicated systems will be a policy for 

integrating entities, to include determining interface requirements and global 

policies to be supported across entities. As soon as these composition 

policies are issued by the DoD, this guideline series will be updated to 

reflect policy changes. In the meantime, for Program Managers faced with the 

more complicated situations not currently dealt with in this series, it is 

hoped that the principles of these guidelines can be extrapolated, using 

guidance from the NCSC-TG-005, Trusted Network Interpretation (TNI) of the 

Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC); NCSC-TG-021, Trusted 

Database Management System Interpretation (TDI) of The Trusted Computer System 

Evaluation Criteria; and NCSC-TG-009, Computer Security Subsystem 

Interpretation (CSSI) of the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria.<p>



<H3><A NAME="HDR1.4   3 11">1.4   BACKGROUND</A></H3>



A Federal Government awareness of the lack of guidance in the security arena 

led to the formation of the DoD Computer Security Evaluation Center (later the 

National Computer Security Center). The Trusted Product Evaluation Program 

(TPEP) was started to provide an &quot;independent laboratory&quot; assessment 

of commercial products.<p>



The TCSEC was published in 1983 and revised to become a DoD standard in 

December 1985 to provide criteria for evaluating security features and 

assurance requirements available in &quot;trusted, commercially available, 

automatic data processing systems.&quot;<p>



The process for acquiring trusted systems is slightly different than other 

acquisitions. The major differences are that 1) the security requirements 

may become a major constraining factor in determining the solution needed to 

meet the remaining requirements and 2) there exists a void of acquisition 

guidance for AIS security.<p>



The challenge for the procurement initiator is to specify the requirements 

with sufficient clarity and flexibility to achieve the desired security 

functions without limiting the ingenuity and ability of the offerors to supply 

a compliant overall solution.<p>



<H2><A NAME="HDR2   2 11">2   PROCUREMENT PROCESS</A></H2>



The procurement process is governed by policy. Here three types of policy 

are distinguished. The first kind of policy is referred to simply as 

security policy or regulatory policy. This is security policy that applies 

to all DoD systems, personnel, and operations. Next, computer security 

policy or COMPUSEC policy is represented by the Division/Class criteria in the 

TCSEC. Finally, operational security policy is that security policy associated 

with a given application including range of classifications, range of 

clearances, categories, mode, and other specific operational security 

decisions that are made. Operational security policy determines which 

Division/Class should be used.<p>



The procurement process begins with various Government personnel determining 

operational requirements. Personnel include, but are not limited to, mission 

users, Program Managers, and acquisition representatives. The primary goals 

during this phase include determining the Division/Class and mode of 

operation, as well as identifying the required security features and 

assurances.<p>



Selection of these security specifications requires a clear understanding of 

the system users' operational and mission needs, the relevant DoD security 

policies, available technologies, and the system's operational environment. 

Procurement initiators and offerors must also consider the security--related 

areas listed in Figure 2-1 below. More detailed information concerning these 

security areas can be found in DoD 5200.1-R, DoD Directive 5200.28, and DoD 

5200.28-M.<p>



 Physical Security<p>



 Communications Security<p>



 Procedural Security<p>



 Emission Security<p>



 Personnel Security<p>



The Designated Approving Authority (DAA) is responsible under Enclosure 4 of 

DoD Directive 5200.28 to determine the minimum AIS computer--based security 

requirements for the mission profile of the system being acquired. Any 

adjustments to computer security evaluation Division/Class (per step 6 of 

enclosure 4) will have been completed prior to using this guideline. The 

Division/Class that results from this assessment may be changed based on other 

factors considered by the DAA. The final Division/Class assigned to the system 

will be used to isolate the appropriate section of the evaluation criteria 

in the TCSEC, (which is organized by Division/Class).<p>



Later in Chapter 5 of this document, we will address specific protection 

topics in the TCSEC. The paragraph will be used that corresponds to the 

Division/Class being supported in this procurement. Chapter 5 will identify 

both Division/Class and the corresponding TCSEC paragraph number to assist the 

procurement initiator in construction of the RFP.<p>



Working with acquisition personnel, the procurement initiators should 

consult this guideline using the Division/Class selected for the system. The 

specification language contained in or referenced by this guideline can be 

applied directly to selected features and assurances. The statements can be 

amplified to meet specific operational requirements. Procurement initiators 

and acquisition personnel must ensure that the security specifications and 

work statements in Section C of the RFP allow EPL solutions, do not preclude 

other solutions, and are compliant with the DAA's accreditation 

requirements. NSA is eager to help in this determination. The requirements 

of the TCSEC will be carried through the development life cycle of the system: 

RFP, contract, test, certification, and accreditation. <p>



<H2><A NAME="HDR3   2 13">3   REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</A></H2>



The RFP is the focus of this procurement guideline series. A standard RFP 

has thirteen sections, each designated by a letter of the alphabet (see 

Table 2). The procurement initiator provides input to and review of all of 

these sections. The majority of the procedural information is controlled 

directly by the procurement activity.  Security relevant sections important to 

the procurement initiator and addressed in the remainder of this document 

are highlighted.<p>

</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="HDR3.1   3 13">3.1   SECTION C - DESCRIPTIONS/SPECIFICATIONS</

A></H3>



The first part of Section C describes the technical requirements to the 

offeror, including the security requirements. The section is mission user-

oriented, and will normally contain a Specification or Requirements section 

that lays out the features and capabilities to included in the system to 

satisfy mission security requirements. The guideline has consolidated the 

security functionality requirements of the TCSEC. This will be addressed in 

detail in Chapter 5.<p>



<H3><A NAME="HDR3.2   3 14">3.2   SECTION C - STATEMENTS OF WORK (SOW)</A></

H3>



The second part of Section C identifies the specific tasks the contractor will 

perform during the contract period and include security related tasking. The 

SOW could include tasks such as system engineering, design, and build. For 

security, Statements of Work include contractor tasking necessary to achieve 

specific levels of assurance, including studies and analyses, configuration 

management, security test and evaluation support, delivery, and maintenance of 

the trusted system. These work statements also specify the development of 

the required documentation to be provided under the Contract Data Requirements 

Lists (CDRLs). This will be addressed in detail in Chapter 5.<p>



<H3><A NAME="HDR3.3   3 14">3.3   SECTION F - DELIVERIES AND PERFORMANCE</A></

H3>



This section covers delivery and installation requirements. Special delivery 

requirements, as specified in the TCSEC, need to be included. Performance 

requirements for the trusted system will also be discussed. This section 

will be addressed further in Chapter of the guideline.<p>



<H3><A NAME="HDR3.4   3 14">3.4   SECTION H - SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS</

A></H3>



This section of the solicitation contains clauses that are specially 

tailored for each acquisition. Typical topics covered include: site access and 

preparation, data rights, maintenance, liquidated damages, and training 

responsibilities. Although these are not addressed specifically in this 

guideline, they are often topics of concern to the procurement initiator of 

trusted systems.<p>



<H3><A NAME="HDR3.5   3 14">3.5   SECTION J - LIST OF DOCUMENTS, EXHIBITS 

AND OTHER ATTACHMENT</A></H3>



This section contains a list of documents, exhibits, attachments, and other 

forms used to build and execute the RFP. There are usually a series of 

attachments, each one dedicated to a list of specific items. Attachments 

addressed by this guideline series include the following:<p>



a.  The Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL). It references specific Data 

Item Description (DID) requirements, which are provided in Volume 3 of the 

Procurement Guideline Series and also are referenced in RFP Attachment A 

contained in Chapter 5. Each SOW task is linked to one or more CDRLs; each 

CDRL identifies a document or other data that the offeror is required to 

deliver, along with specific information about that document (e.g. schedule, 

number and frequency of revisions, distribution). Associated with each CDRL is 

a DID that specifies the document's content and format. Where requirements 

differ, there are unique DIDs for each Division/Class.<p>



b.  Glossary. Even though it is presented separately, the glossary is an 

important part of the specifications and the Statements of Work because it 

precisely defines terms and further clarifies the language intent. The 

glossary is included as RFP Attachment B in Chapter 5 of this guideline.<p>



c.  Acronyms. Acronyms used in the RFP must be defined in their first us and 

must also be identified in the accompanying acronym list. Acronyms are 

included as RFP Attachment C in Chapter 5 of this guideline.<p>



d.  References. References have been identified for incorporation into the 

RFP. Terms support and are compatible with the specification language, and 

as such, become an integral part. The references are for technical 

supporting information and should not be interpreted as requirements. 

References are included as RFP Attachment D Chapter 5 of this guideline. <p>



<H3><A NAME="HDR3.6   3 15">3.6   SECTION L - INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND 

NOTICES TO OFFERORS</A></H3>



This section contains the instructions and conditions of the acquisition. It 

informs offerors of their actions and responsibilities, if they are planning 

to submit a proposal. It covers such things as proposal format, oral 

presentations, and the proposal preparation instructions. Proposal preparation 

instructions can be used to an advantage by requiring the offerors to submit 

outlines of how they will conduct SOW tasking. This will assist in 

understanding the offeror's technical approach and allow assessment of their 

understanding of the technical requirements. This will be addressed in 

detail in Chapter 5 of this guideline.<p>



<H3><A NAME="HDR3.7   3 15">3.7   SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</

A></H3>



This presents to the bidder the basis of award and how proposals will be 

evaluated. It should be taken from the Government's proposal evaluation 

criteria, addressed in Volume 4 of this guideline series.<p>



<H2><A NAME="HDR4   2 15">4   OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</A></H2>



There are other important factors to consider before the RFP language is 

presented.<p>



<H3><A NAME="HDR4.1   3 15">4.1   NONMANDATORY REQUIREMENTS AND OPTIONS</A></

H3>



An alternative for procurement initiators is to specify nonmandatory 

requirements. These requirements are placed in the RFP. The bidder may respond 

to these requirements or choose not to respond. The bidder will not be 

penalized for not responding or for proposing an unacceptable response. The 

bidder can, however, gain points if the approach is deemed acceptable by the 

evaluators.<p>



Nonmandatory requirements and solutions can also be proposed by the bidder 

if this is allowed by the RFP. Again bidders will not be penalized for not 

proposing nonmandatory requirements, for proposing unacceptable 

requirements, for proposing unacceptable solutions, or for proposing 

unacceptable desirable options or features. They can gain points by 

proposing acceptable solutions to acceptable requirements, whether these 

requirements become part of the contract or not.<p>



Options are requirements that may be proposed by the Government, but that 

are not necessarily intended to be purchased at the same time as the rest of 

the features. The Government may still want these options addressed in the 

proposal and evaluated as if they were mandatory requirements.<p>



<H3><A NAME="HDR4.2   3 16">4.2   EVIDENCE AVAILABILITY</A></H3>



Though a vendor supplies NSA with evidence to support a product evaluation, 

the Government does not necessarily have rights to that documentation. In 

order to obtain certification evidence, even the identical documents 

provided for product evaluation, the Government must task the development of 

the documentation in the Statement of Work and delivery in the CDRL. Of 

course, only that documentation that is required for certification and 

operation should be specified.<p>



<H3><A NAME="HDR4.3   3 16">4.3   DOCUMENTATION COST</A></H3>



The cost for operational security documentation (e.g. Security Feature 

User's Guide and Trusted Facility Manual) can be incurred within the 

contract or directly by the Government. A contract cost is incurred if the 

operational security documentation is specifically called out in the RFP and 

therefore generated to Government standards by the offeror. The cost would 

be incurred directly by the Government if the acquiring agency Program Manager 

intends to develop the documentation internally. This makes the system 

appear less expensive. Unfortunately, users seldom have the experience and 

expertise necessary to generate this unique type of documentation. This can 

lead to cost growth manifested in contract Engineering Change Proposals 

(ECPs).<p>



<H3><A NAME="HDR4.4   3 16">4.4   INTERPRETING THE TCSEC</A></H3>



The philosophy of this document is to present the words of the TCSEC and 

then place the responsibility for changes in the hands of the procurement 

initiator, all the while warning of the pitfalls. The best approach is for the 

initiator to propose changes and have them reviewed by NSA, or some other 

equivalent security organization, to assess impact. Care must be taken not 

to restrict potentially valid solutions when writing the specification or 

Statement of Work sections of the RFP.<p>



The features and assurances for a given TCSEC Division/Class are 

inseparable. If requirements or taskings are eliminated from a specific 

level of trust, then that level cannot be certified. If requirements are 

added, existing EPL solutions could be eliminated.<p>



The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is the totality of protection mechanisms, 

hardware, software and/or firmware, the collection of which is responsible for 

enforcing security. The TCB is the trusted part, but not necessarily the 

total, of the offeror's solution.<p>



<H2><A NAME="HDR5   2 17">5   STANDARD SOLICITATION LANGUAGE</A></H2>



To assist the reader, the paragraph numbering that follows is as one might 

expect to find it in the RFP. This chapter identifies the language to be 

used in the RFP.<p>



Certain conventions are used in this chapter. The words in bold are either 

words intended for use in the RFP or references to words intended for use in 

the RFP. For example, bold paragraphs normally reference specific paragraphs 

of DoD 5200.28-STD that are suggested for use verbatim in the RFP document. 

Paragraphs applicable to only a Division/Class range will have that range in 

parentheses prior to the paragraph or group of paragraphs. Paragraphs in which 

the Division/Class are absent are applicable to all Divisions/Classes (C2--

A1).<p>



Topics in Section C are divided into paragraphs as follows:<p>



a. <U>Text of the Specification or Statement of Work. These are words or 

references to words suggested for inclusion in the RFP.</U><p>



b. <U>Important References. These references should be included in the RFP. 

They are generally guidelines intended to explain and interpret the TCSEC 

for the bidder. These references will be redundantly contained in the list 

of references accompanying the RFP. It is important to emphasize that even 

though these references are bold and will be contained in the RFP, they are 

not RFP requirements.</U><p>



c. <U>Procurement Considerations. Here issues are discussed that have arisen 

in previous procurements or are apt to arise in future procurements. These 

issues should be considered by the procurement initiator in the context of 

his/her particular procurement to circumvent possible later contractual or 

certification problems. These considerations are not complete, but offer 

guidance based on known experiences. They are not in bold and therefore we 

do not automatically intend their inclusion in the RFP. Only if the 

procurement initiator decides to make them requirements will they be 

included in the RFP.</U><p>



The standard language and form for the trusted elements of a secure system, 

along with important discussion, are provided in the remainder of this 

chapter, organized according to a subset of the sections of the RFP. <p>

NCSC-TG-003, A Guide to Understanding Discretionary Access Control in 

Trusted Systems, September 30, 1987.<p>



Discretionary Access Control Procurement Considerations<p>



Unauthorized users include both those not authorized to use the system and 

legitimate users not authorized to access a specific piece of information 

being protected.<p>



&quot;Users&quot; do not include &quot;operators,&quot; &quot;system 

programmers,&quot; &quot;Security Officers,&quot; and other system support 

personnel. The latter are distinct from users and are subject to the Trusted 

Facility Management and the System Architecture requirements. <p>



Deletion of subjects (e.g., users) and objects (e.g., data) is a potential 

problem. The mechanism should handle the deletion effectively, making 

certain that dangling references do not grant unintended access.<p>



The ability to assign access permissions to an object by a user should be 

controlled with the same precision as the ability to access the objects 

themselves. Four basic models for control exist: hierarchical, concept of 

ownership, laissez--faire, and centralized. These are discussed in NCSC-TG-

003.<p>



The TCB should enforce need--to--know access restrictions placed on 

information managed by the information system. The need--to--know access 

restrictions for the information, when created or changed, should be 

determined by the office of primary responsibility or the originator of the 

information. Only users determined to have appropriate clearances in 

addition to required "need-to-know" for information should be allowed to 

access the information. <p>



The design must consider that discretionary access control is usually used for 

both user access control and system access control. For example, the system 

may contain several types of objects (known as public objects) that are 

designed to be read by all users, or executed by all users, but allowing 

only trusted subjects modification privileges.<p>



Discretionary access control will not stop Trojan horses. An attacker can 

trick a more privileged user to run a program containing a Trojan horse that 

in turn copies the user access files to the attackers address space. Trojan 

horses are addressed in NCSC-TG-003.<p>



The commercial--off--the--shelf (COTS) systems may vary with respect to the 

granularity of objects to which discretionary access control is applied. 

Generally, they are organized to provide discretionary access control (DAC) at 

the file level or at the application level. Database design can often handle 

the cases when a different level of granularity is desired by the procuring 

agency so that EPL products can apply. The procuring agency should take 

particular care, whenever possible, to write RFP specifications for DAC that 

can be met by at least some existing commercially available products. (This is 

further addressed in Volume 1, Chapter 3.)<p>

<U>Object Reuse Procurement Considerations</U><p>



The purpose of object reuse mechanisms is to prevent disclosure of sensitive 

information by ensuring that residual information is no longer available. This 

objective can be achieved by clearing objects either upon allocation or 

deallocatation.<p>



Object reuse is a concern when an object is not fully allocated, that is the 

granularity is larger than the data. The object reuse requirement must be 

satisfied based on the object size, not the data allocation.<p>

<U>Labels Procurement Considerations</U><p>



The tranquillity principle states that the security level of an object 

cannot change while the object is being processed by a system. The same can be 

stated about changes to security clearances. This is a critical area, both 

from the standpoint of changes only being invocable by an authorized 

individual under the direct control of the TCB and ensuring the system 

cannot be spoofed when such changes are being made.<p>



Labeling of data is not used solely to control classified information. The 

mandatory policy can also be used for unclassified sensitive or privacy 

applications.<p>



A distinction must be made between objects that are explicitly labeled and 

those that are implicitly labeled. For example, a labeled file may contain 

many tuples or records mediated by the reference monitor.<p>



Internal TCB variables that are not visible to untrusted subjects need not 

be labeled, provided they are not directly or indirectly accessible by 

subjects external to the TCB. However, it is important to understand that such 

internal variables can function as covert signalling channels when untrusted 

subjects are able to detect changes in these variables by observing system 

behavior.<p>

Care is needed when specifying the means of binding an object and its

provide assurance of the binding since the relationship and content are 

preserved, and there is protection from disclosure.<p>



The form of internal sensitivity labels may differ from their external 

(exported) form, but the meaning must be retained.<p>

The sensitivity label of an object imported to a multilevel device must be

Sometimes operational use of a single level device is actually to be at one

wise to employ labels. If labels are not used, then tranquillity must be 

observed during configuration change with a positive action to ensure the

mechanism.<p>

This subject is discussed in Volume 1, Chapter 3 of the Procurement 

Guideline Series.<p>



Technology has provided techniques and products that vary greatly in terms 

of reducing attack risk while satisfying these requirements. The procurement 

initiator should ensure that the solution that satisfies the requirements is 

also state--of--the--art in level of protection and consistent with the 

requirements of this particular application.<p>



To be effective, authentication mechanisms must uniquely and unforgeably 

identify an individual. Identification and authentication data is vulnerable 

to interception by an intruder interposed between a user and the TCB. 

Compromise may result from mishandling off--line versions of the data (e.g., 

backup files, fault induced system dumps, or listings). Even a one--way 

encrypted file can be compared with an encryption dictionary of probable 

authentication data, if the encryption algorithm and key are known.<p>



(Classes B1--A1) Authorizations include functional roles assigned to 

individuals. Most roles can only be occupied by one person at a time. A role 

has its own set of authorizations that are normally different than the 

authorizations given to the individuals who can assume the role. An individual 

should not be allowed to assume a role and operate as an individual at the 

same time.<p>



If passwords are to be used, an automatic password generator is strongly 

recommended. If users are allowed to pick their own specific authenticators, 

their behavior is stereotypical enough to permit guessing or reproducing. 

Password generators are available that have been endorsed by NSA and can be 

obtained as Government off--the--shelf items. <p>



Password aging is an important consideration that can be enforced 

administratively or by the identification/authentication function.<p>



Smart cards and biometric approaches are effective, especially when they 

augment a password approach.<p>



Whenever the subject is an operating computer program (i.e., a process), 

that process shall be directly associated with just one individual user, i.e., 

the person being served by the process. If the process is a system--owned 

process (e.g., a background process such as a print spooler), the person 

associated with the process is generally considered to be the Security 

Officer, the System Administrator, or the operator who initiated the 

process. The security level and other subject data that can influence access 

decisions shall be within the range of personnel security clearances 

associated with the individual user. <p>

Trusted Path Procurement Considerations<p>



It is important to note that the intent is to protect identification and 

authentication data at the B2 level, while at the B3 and A1 levels all 

intercommunications between the TCB and the user can be protected.<p>



Technology is providing products that greatly reduce the possibility of 

successful attacks involving the trusted path. The procurement initiator 

should ensure that the solution that satisfies the requirements is also state-

-of--the--art in level of protection.<p>

NCSC-TG-001, A Guide to Understanding Audit in Trusted Systems, June 1, 

1988.<p>



Audit Procurement Considerations<p>



The option should exist that either some maximum of security related 

activities be audited or that the System Administrator select events to be 

audited based on overhead considerations.<p>



An audit control switch available to the System Administrator can allow 

selection of audit levels, but never to allow less than some required 

minimum as determined by the DAA. <p>



A requirement exists that authorized personnel shall be able to read all 

events recorded on the audit trail. A selection option is required that may 

either be a preselection or a post selection option. The preselection option 

limits the audit data recorded. The post selection option reduces the data 

analyzed from that recorded.<p>



Switches and options must not violate the requirements and intent of the 

TCSEC.<p>



The audit information should be sufficient to reconstruct a complete 

sequence of security related events. Audit analysis tools can greatly 

enhance the efficiency of the audit control function for the System 

Administrator. (See NCSC-TG-001 for further discussion.)<p>



The capability should be provided to prevent System Administrator and Security 

Officer functions from turning off auditing or modifying those results. <p>



Only the System Administrator or Security Officer should be able to select 

what is to be audited from other events.<p>



(Classes B3--A1) The requirement to &quot;monitor the occurrence or 

accumulation of security auditable events that may indicate an imminent 

violation of security policy&quot; is subject to interpretation. It is the 

topic of an entire subfield of security known as intrusion detection. The 

DAA must determine what is reasonable in the context of the particular 

application.<p>



(Classes B3--A1) &quot;If the occurrence or accumulation of these security 

relevant events continues, the system shall take the least disruptive action 

to terminate the event.&quot; The approach taken is very application 

peculiar and the DAA must further specify the action to be taken.<p>

System Architecture Procurement Considerations<p>



&quot;Domain&quot; as used in the TCSEC refers to the set of objects a subject 

has the ability to access. It is, for example, the protection environment in 

which a process is executing. Domain is sometimes also called 

&quot;context&quot; or &quot;address space.&quot;<p>



Protection granularity can be an issue. Finer granularity (e.g., a few 

bytes) is ideal for providing precise control (down to the byte or word 

level), but requires a significant amount of computer overhead to maintain. 

The trade--off usually made is to have coarser granularity (e.g., 1024 byte 

blocks) to reduce hardware complexity and retain acceptable performance. 

(See Volume 1, Chapter 3 of this guideline series.)<p>



An important consideration is sensitivity label mapping to protection domain 

mechanisms. Hardware features (usually called &quot;keys&quot;) allow the 

TCB to associate specific hardware &quot;registers&quot; with the main 

memory areas (domains) they are protecting. There should be sufficient types 

and numbers of &quot;registers&quot; to ensure the number of sensitivity 

labels for information in the system can be adequately mapped. Common ways 

to achieve these capabilities are through &quot;Descriptor Base 

Registers,&quot; &quot;Bounds Registers,&quot; and &quot;Virtual Memory 

Mapping Registers,&quot; although other approaches may also be used.<p>



Asynchronous events are not predictable (e.g., arrival of a message, the 

printer running out of paper, or communications link errors). Asynchronous 

event mechanisms are hardware features that handle the unpredictable, 

usually by &quot;interrupting&quot; the processor. Once interrupted, the 

processor then deals with the event. Interpretation of DoD 5200.28-STD will 

probably require hardware features that will cause the processor to 

recognize and respond to specific asynchronous events, such as 

&quot;security policy violations&quot; (in DoD 5200.28-STD phrasing, 

violations of the Simple Security Property or Star Property). Unless 

hardware features support these properties, software must interpret the 

results of every operation, causing a severe performance penalty. The 

penalty may come into conflict with mission performance requirements.<p>

TCSEC<B> Section 8.0, &quot;A Guideline on Covert Channels.&quot;</B><p>



Covert Channel Procurement Considerations<p>



The TCSEC only requires the analysis of covert channels, tradeoffs involved in 

restricting the channels, and identification of the auditable events that 

may be used in the exploitation of known channels. Here it requires that 

some action be taken for correcting them. The procurement initiator should 

clearly specify in the RFP what will be expected of a contractor. Proposal 

evaluation should further determine what is intended by the bidder. This issue 

must be clearly understood by the Government and the bidder and documented 

in the specification before an award is made.<p>



Covert channel auditing and control mechanisms can vary widely from one system 

to another. In general, the ability to meet both performance and security 

requirements increases as the security protection mechanisms become more 

flexible.<p>

NCSC-TG-015, A Guide to Understanding Trusted Facility Management, October 18, 

1989.<p>



Trusted Facility Management Procurement Considerations<p>



The TCSEC addresses System Administrator functions and operator functions 

and specifically identifies the Automated Data Processing (ADP) System 

Administrator. The roles and individuals must be specifically identified for 

this particular application and the RFP should show the mapping of 

particular roles and those called out in the TCSEC. For example, if the 

Security Officer and the ADP System Administrator are one and the same, it 

should be stated or only one title should be used consistently throughout 

the RFP. If there is more than one operator role, this should be 

identified.<p>



The acquisition authority must carefully consider the division of functions 

between the operator and the System Administrator because the cost of changing 

them is often high.<p>

Trusted Recovery Procurement Considerations<p>



Satisfactory recovery can have significantly different meaning to different 

applications because of differences in the time criticality of operational 

results. The procurement initiator must be certain that the true operational 

requirements for this particular application are reflected in the RFP. <p>



Note that satisfaction of this requirement does not guarantee data recovery. 

It keeps the system from blindly compromising data and allows the System 

Administrator to reach a known good point in the process where other mission 

mechanisms (e.g., backup) can safely proceed. Trusted recovery does not 

obviate the need for responsible backup procedures and practices.<p>

<U>Security Testing Procurement Considerations</U><p>



Many of the statements in the security testing requirements are subject to 

interpretation, (e.g., &quot;relatively resistant to penetration,&quot; 

&quot;consistency with top level specifications,&quot; &quot;no more than a 

few correctable flaws,&quot; and &quot;reasonable confidence that few 

remain&quot;). The procurement initiator in the RFP must attempt to convey 

in any manner possible what will be expected by the Government, not only in 

satisfying the security testing requirement, but in terms of meeting the 

certification evaluation. Similarly, in evaluation of the bidder's response to 

testing requirements of the RFP, the Government must be very careful to 

understand that the contractor understands what is required. As an example, 

there is a great advantage in identifying who will conduct the penetration 

analysis (B2 and above) and how the results of that penetration will be 

dealt with. A clear understanding must exist and be documented before an award 

is made.<p>

The contractor should conduct an analysis to identify the functions 

performed by the role of the System Administrator. This analysis should 

identify all nonsecurity functions that can be performed in the System 

Administrator role. The contractor should conduct an analysis to determine, 

for the operator and System Administrator, the specific cautions about 

functions and privileges that should be controlled while running a secure 

facility and the specific interactions of the protection features. The 

contractor should also conduct an engineering analysis of the system to 

identify all information and events to be audited, including rationale 

(i.e., cost, conformance to requirements, security, and performance impacts) 

for the selection of each item. The contractor should also identify the 

types of events that occur within the system that are not audited, along 

with reasons for not auditing them.<p>

<U>Section L Procurement Considerations</U><p>



In procuring EPL products, a goal is to use as much of the existing 

documentation and certification evidence as possible in satisfaction of the 

requirements of the contract. Usually this data does not belong to the 

Government. Thus bidders are encouraged to seek out and attempt to buy or 

otherwise obtain existing documentation from the developing vendor in an 

attempt to reduce the cost and risk of the bid and ensuing contract. <U>This 

approach can also provide a significant competitive advantage for EPL 

solutions.</U><p>
