FOREWORD
------------------------------------------------------------------

I decided to release this update after being flamed by several
people telling me just how wrong I am, and that I should "check
my facts" before posting.

Note, however, that I _did_ check my facts.
All I did was analyze the "jolt2.c" code as presented, which
means I had the facts right in front of me.

Reportedly, this code snippet is not the same code used as
in finding the vulnerability. Hence, I'm theorizing quite
a bit and freely questioning the results.

This update contains a few corrections (snafus on my part)
aswell as comments from other people, mainly Phonix, who
wrote the proof-of-concept snippet "jolt2.c".

------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS OF JOLT2.C (attached)
------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two modes of operation:
- Illegaly fragmented ICMP ECHOs (pings)
- Illegaly fragmented UDP packets

They both send out a continous stream of identical
fragments (same offset, same frag ID, same everything)
where the fragments are constructed such that:

- ALL fragments are sent with fragment offset 65520.
  (REVISED: I found this snafu myself. The value transmitted
   is 8190, but this is the number of 64-bit blocks, so the
   real offset is 65520.)
- 9 bytes of IP data are sent (total packet length 29)
- IP packet ID is 0x0455
- TTL is initially 255
- Source address is not spoofed
- Destination address is victim address
- IP checksum is set to zero (should be illegal)
  (REVISED! If the checksum is automatically computed by
   the IP stack or the NIC, it won't be zero)
- IP total length is set to 68 (IP+8+40) (illegal!)
- The IP MF flag is set to zero (last fragment)

The code also ensures that correct UDP/ICMP headers are
sent. However, do not be fooled by this behaviour.
The headers are NOT sent in a fragment with offset zero,
so they will never be parsed as UDP/ICMP headers by
the recipient. They are treated as "just another 9 bytes
of data".

As such, all that can be said is that it is sending "UDP"
or "ICMP" data. It is NOT sending a specific ICMP type,
and it is NOT sending to a specific UDP port!

Point taken, Phonix :-)


The ICMP header sent is an ICMP ECHO (ping) with
  code=0
  checksum=0
  unused 32-bit value = 0
  the one data byte = 0

The UDP header sent has dest port = user-specified,
  src port = user-specified (binary OR) 1235
  checksum = 0
  UDP total length = 9
  the one data byte = 'a'

Again: No one will parse these headers, it's just
       "another 9 bytes of data".


In the source, the IP checksum is set to zero. I incorrectly
took this to mean that it won't propagate across routers, and
that the MS IP stack accepts them even though the checksum
is invalid. However:

The code never mentioned this, and I failed to think of it.
However :

If someone can verify that the problem still exists when
checksums are _transmitted_ as zero, we'd all be grateful.
This would illustrate an even worse failing in the MS
stack. According to RFC1812, the only action taken
on a packet before the checksum check should be to verify
that it is large enough to contain the basic IP header.
(Flames begone! I said "would"!)


In reading the code, I noticed that there is no rate
limit on the fragments sent. Rather, it sends an unlimited
stream of fragments as fast as the sender can handle.

I originally thought that this _may_ be proof of another
problem - What if _this_ code isn't exploiting a fragmentation
vulnerability, but rather a network layer resource exhaustion
vulnerability? The net results could be the same (CPU and RAM
crunching), but be caused by entirely different reasons.

Several people have told (flamed?) me that I am completely wrong,
simply because the Microsoft and Bindview advisories state
that it is a fragmentation problem.

This does not change the facts however. I would _really_
like to see this code (jolt2.c) have the same results
_WITH_ rate limiting implemented before I blindly accept
the results. (I'm not saying anyone is lying here, I just
like seeing proof before accepting something as facts.)


Again, analyzing the structure of the fragments.

- The data _sent_ is 29 bytes (20 IP + 9 data), which is valid
  as it is a last fragment (MF=0).

- However, the total length reported by the IP header is 68
  bytes. This means that the packet should fail structural
  tests, if there are any. [snip poisonous statement about
  A Large OS Vendor's code quality]
  Receipt of a packet with a reported length being larger
  than the actual received length is a normal occurence,
  it'll happen any time a packet is truncated during transport.

- According to the IP header total length, the amount of
  IP data is 48 bytes. Since the offset is 65520, this would
  result in a IP packet length overflow; the maximum allowed
  length is 65535.
  Note however that the data sent (9 bytes) would not cause
  an overflow.

- Fragments are flagged as being "last fragments".

------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSIONS OF THE ATTACK
------------------------------------------------------------------

In conclusion, I see two ways that this could cause crashes:

1. Microsoft doesn't verify the structural integrity (the
   packet is truncated!)
   Microsoft fails to detect that the fragment would overflow
   the IP length limit.
   Microsoft stores all fragments received, consuming large
   amounts of RAM and perhaps triggering something very
   time-consuming for every fragment received
   (This is sort of odd however, since all fragments have
   the same offset, they should simply overwrite eachother?)
   The fragment will never reassemble.

2. It is really a network layer resource exhaustion attack
   rather than a fragmentation attack. (NOTE! THIS IS JUST
   A THEORY! I WOULD HAPPILY BE PROVEN WRONG HERE, BUT PLEASE
   PROVIDE PROOF RATHER THAN JUST FLAME ME!)

I can see how 1) could cause problems. If there is some sort
of garbage collection mechanism, it would attempt to find
the "oldest" reassembly attempt and discard it when resources
are running low. However, all fragments belong to the
same reassembly. So, if the garbage collection routine isn't
able to detect that there's something fishy with the "current"
reassembly and discard IT, we'd get resource exhaustion.

HOW DO FIREWALLS PROTECT AGAINST THIS ATTACK?
------------------------------------------------------------------

(STATEFUL) PACKET FILTERING FIREWALLS:

* The packet fails structural integrity tests. The reported
  length (68) is much larger than the received length (29).
  However: A broken router may decide to send 68 bytes when
  forwarding it (adding 39 bytes of random padding).
  I do not know what impact this will have on the receiving
  end.

* This incarnation of the attack is also illegal in that it
  wraps the IP packet size limit. The IP data length reported
  is 48, and the offset is 65520.

* If the firewall has any sort of (pseudo)fragment reassembly,
  it shouldn't forward a single packet, since there are
  no valid fragments preceding the attack sequence.

* If the firewall maps fragments to open connections, it
  should detect that there is no open connection for this
  particular packet, thereby discarding it.

PROXY FIREWALLS:

* A proxy function will never pass this attack pattern to
  the protected network. (Note: assumes that there is no
  packet filtering functionality applied to the firewall)

* If the proxy firewall is running on a vulnerable OS and
  doesn't have its own network layer code (relies on the MS stack),
  the attack will DoS the firewall itself, effectively
  DoSing your entire connection.


ANY TYPE FIREWALL:

* If the firewall does fragment reassembly in an incorrect
  way (maybe by trusting vulnerable MS stacks to do it), it
  will be vulnerable to the attack, regardless of which
  type of firewall it is.

I will NOT speculate on which firewall is vulnerable to
direct attack, protects against the attack, or passes
it through.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, that's it for this time. Again, please remember that this
is an analysis of "jolt2.c" as provided to the security community.
I have no intimate knowledge of the attack described by MS00-029
or Bindview, other than that publicly announced by them.

The source of jolt2.c is attached.
