For those of you that use(d) WorldSpy for free Internet access, you now know how you have to
switch to Juno or use someone else. Well, I checked them out. Their software SUCKS.
  So...
___________________________________________________________________
Purpose: to defeat the proprietary 'JUNO' server type and enable
PPP so that any PPP device (such as Windows DUN or Linux, etc) can
connect and use (read: steal) its services.

[v1.3; god, I screwed it up thrice already.. but this should work.]

1. Open Dial-up Networking.
2. Right click on Juno Web icon, properties.
3. Server types tab, change drop down to reflect 'PPP'.
4  Open Network Control Panel applet. Go into Dialup Adapter properties. 
   Enable logging. Hit OK and Reboot.
5. Run Juno. Connect to the web.
6. Close Juno and disconnect after it connects.
7. Open Wordpad, and open the file 'C:\Windows\ppplog.txt'
8. Scroll down until you find "jweb".
9. In that area, you will find a line that contains a few letters and some numbers,
   and then '@jweb' (then maybe other stuff, depending on the area in which you live) 
   and then '.juno.com'. The 12 letters/numbers plus '@jweb<whatever else>.juno.com'
   is your full username.
   Write it down or open a notepad and paste it. 
   Username example: ub1700011293@jweb.juno.com [another ex: ub1601025790@jweb-level3.juno.com]
10. Right after the .com is a dot, and then starts your encrypted password, which is most likely
    16 characters. Write it down.
    Password example: xjyKBaLCBYzf83lq [another: EhmbKpjIf0mOGzHj]
11. Step 1.
12. Step 2.
13. Step 4, except you *disable* logging. Rebooting sucks.
14. Rename 'Juno Web' Icon to something else. Double click it.
15. Punch in username and password.
16. Have fun with your faster access, no banners, no bloated software! Uninstall it! USE LINUX!@#

This works generally the same way with Altavista FreeAccess as well, except for the specifics
like username/pass size, and so forth. Figure it out. ;)
