==[Overview]==

GrrCON is an information security and hacking conference held annually
in the Midwest. This conference was put together to provide the
information security community with a venue to come together and share
ideas, information, solutions, forge relationships, and most
importantly engage with like minded people in a fun atmosphere. No
egos, no rock stars, just a good time and good content.

==[Why GrrCON]==

We offer three tracks, training, workshops, solutions arena, contests,
an after party, and more to ensure you get the most out of the event.
-= oh yea.. and FREE BEER and FOOD both days for EVERYBODY =====

As always we try to PAY our speakers as much as possible for speaking
at GrrCON.
Not all speakers or presentations are created equally, we hold to this
ideal by varying the honorarium we provide.
We also understand not all speakers can accept payment. Therefore,
speakers can negotiate additional tickets in exchange for honorariums,
subject to approval on an individual basis. Like everything we do,
weâre flexible and want to ensure everybody (even our speakers) have a
great time. If you have any thoughts or crazy negotiation ideas let us
know.

-= All accepted speakers will also receive a VIP Ticket for themselves
to enjoy the rest of the conference =====
