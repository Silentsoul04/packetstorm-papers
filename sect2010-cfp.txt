                   "OMG, it's full of stars!"

                  Sept 9-10 Stockholm, Sweden
                     http://www.sec-t.org/

We are currently soliciting presentations for the third annual SEC-T
technical security conference in Stockholm on the 9-10th of September.
The theme for this year will be "OMG, it's full of stars!" and if you
could weave that into your presentation somehow, that would be cool.

The topics of interest for this conference are information security
related, but strongly rooted in the technical realm. For an idea of
what we like, please check out the speakers lists from previous years
at http://www.sec-t.org/. Anything submitted will be considered and
we will judge each proposal by its content and not the name attached.

Proposals should include a short description of the talk contents 
and a brief speakers bio. Send all submissions to cfp@sec-t.org.

Thanks to all past speakers and attendees for making this possible,

The SEC-T organizing committee.
