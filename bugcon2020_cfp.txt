--[ Description ]--

BugCON 2020 will take place in the whole world from November 26th - 28th.

Hey... have you said the whole world?

Yes... because of COVID-19, this year BugCON will be available to the
whole world on the Internet!

----[ Background ]----

BugCON Security Conference: Safety is just a myth...! is the biggest
security conference in Mexico since 2008, yes, you read 2008... more than ten
years of BugCON.


--[ Approach ]--

BugCON is merely a technical security conference. BugCON is focused in
getting together security researchers, security professionals, companies,
universities and government agencies with the purpose of showing their
latest research, networking with people involved in security fields and get
drunk ;) ... all taking place in an uncensored environment.

That's the reason why BugCON only accepts really hardcore technical talks
and workshops related with security fields,like: research, new techniques,
vulnerabilities, projects, etc. No business talks... neither "CSI of
computers" nor yellow scarves.

This year, BugCON will be on-line, but do not worry, it will work to bring
a very nice experience for speakers and attendees, no matter if we are a long
distance away.
