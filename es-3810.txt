On with the show...


First off there are some definitions, and Acronyms to be familiar with.

AMI (ATM Management Interface) - The user interface to switching control 
    software.  AMI lets you monitor and change various operating configurations of 
    switches and network module hardware and software, IP connectivity, and SNMP 
    network management

Bandwidth- usually identifies the capacity of data that can be sent through a given
           circuit; may be user-specified in a PVC.

CBR (Constant Bit Rate)- A type of traffic that requires a continuous, specific
     amount of bandwidth over the ATM network (e.g., digital information such as video
     and digitized voice

ANSI (American National Standards Institute)- A private organization that coordinates
     the setting and approval of some U.S standards.  It also represents the U.S ISO

BIP (Bit Interleaved Parity)- An error detection technique in which character bit patterns
    are forced into parity, so that the total number of one bits is always odd or even.

DSR (Data Set Ready)- an RS-232 modem interface control signal (sent from the modem to the DTE 
    on pin 6) which indicates that the modem is connected to the telephone circuit.

DTE (Data Terminal Equipment)- generally user devices, such as terminals and computers that 
    connect to data circuit terminating equipment.  They either generate or capture data
    sent by the network

ATDM (Asynchronous Time Division Multiplexing)- A method of sending information that
      resembles normal TDM, except that time slots are allocated as needed rather
      than prearranged to specific transmitters.

EM- The CellPath 300 extension module; paired with the system controller and supporting
    an optional PCMCIA card.

FDDI (Fiber distributed Data Interface)- High-speed data network that uses fiber-optic as 
     the physical medium

EPROM- Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory.

CLP (Cell Loss Priority)- the last bit of byte four in an ATM cell header; indicates
    the eligibility of the cell for discard by the network under congested conditions.  


[Introductory to the Management Station
------------------*

The ES-3810 is a switching architecture; it provides one with the ability to work with 
multiple switched Ethernet ports along with high performance ATM server and backbone connections 
to work with powerful network managing. 

The management console for the ES-3810 uses a menu based interface that utilizes
A VT-100  terminal or VT-100 emulator like ProComm or PC Plus.  The serial interface 
of the ES-3810 connects directly to either the DTE interface of the ASCII terminal or 
a serial port of the PC or workstation running terminal emulation.

Note: If the NMM's SNMP-based management or IGMP support is going to be used, a console
      connection is required the first time the NMM is brought online since an IP address,
      subnet mask and possibly a gateway must be defined.

[VLAN Assignments
------------------------*

VLANs are OSI Layer 2 [data link] multicast domains.  VLAN membership is 
not necessarily tied to a physical proximity.  The ES-3810 supports three
criteria: MAC address based assignment to a VLAN, IP Multicast Group based
assignment, and port base assignment.

[MAC Address based and Port based VLANs
---------------------------------------*

MAC address based VLAN assignments supersedes port based VLAN assignment. 
By adding an ATM module you can extend any VLAN into ATM by assigning a LEC
(Lan Emulation Client) instance to the VLAN.  A VLAN extended into ATM must
be named with the same NAME and CASE as the ELAN for example, an ELAN called
"Lab" exists and you want the station on ES-3810 port 16 to join it.  On the 
#s-3810 you must create a VLAN called "Lab" (case sensitive) and assign port 
16 to it.  when asked to "configure a LEC" say yes.  The ES-3810 will join 
(in proxy) the ELAN called "Lab" and allows the station port 16 communication 
rights.


[IGMP Based VLANs
---------------------------------------*
Some TCP/IP applications use IP multicasts to deliver data to many stations
at once.  How ever multicasting can cause problems because stations that are
not interested in receiving multicast data to see it anyway.  This causes 
Ethernet segment congestion and unnecessary interrupts on workstations.  
Filtering these multicasts via IGMP can reduce congestion and keep the network
moving smoothly.

IGMP is designed to add further granularity within a VLAN.  If a station from two
separate VLANS join the same IP multicast group; the IP multicast stream has to be 
sourced twice.  The IP client of the ES-3810 is reachable from the first configured
VLAN, independent of that VLANs name. Since, by default the first VLAN is called "default"

[Routerless Network
------------------------*

A routerless network is one in which the ES-3810 switches Ethernet attached host to ATM
where high speed servers are found.  Typically one or several of the following apply

* Network has no VLAN-to-VLAN traffic requirement
* Primary NOS is client/server based
* Security is a MAJOR concern (trust me on this one)
* Servers are on ATM for maximum performance

Any network matching one or more of the above scenarios would benefit from a 
routerless network because clients from different VLANs can access the same 
server but not other VLANs

[Centralized Routing Network
----------------------------*

A centralized routing network is one in which the ES-3810 switches Ethernet
attached host to ATM where high-speed servers and router interfaces are found.
Typically the ES-3810 can be utilized in a network that meets one or more of 
the following criteria


* Maintenance of relatively flat network
* Some VLAN to VLAN connectivity
* Some VLAN to VLAN packet level filtering/firewalling
* Traffic is 80% local and 20% routed
* Network could collapse into fewer subnets by switching to ATM


[Exploiting TFTP/ES-3810
------------------------*

Issuing the command line rs  :/cd usr do _filter area_ off will disable POST recognition
by other users.  Another thing that can be done is gaining remote access this can only 
happen if TFTP is binded to the system, and on the same subnet as the ES-3810 system. 
(which it should be by default if utilized). Since there is no password authentication
you can use tftp to access the systems password file. Although you have read access to
the password file other flags, and restricted privileges keep you from deleting any
critical data.  Logs maybe?  =] ..  More will be written on  ES-3810  
security features/insecurities when time permits.


To fix this disable TFTP by issuing the following command

lou% tftp dgram udp wait user /etc/tftpd tftpd -n
