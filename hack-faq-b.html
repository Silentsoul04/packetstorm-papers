<a name="b01">1. What is a Red Box?</a>
</p> <p>
When a coin is inserted into a payphone, the payphone emits a set of
tones to ACTS (Automated Coin Toll System).  Red boxes work by fooling
ACTS into believing you have actually put money into the phone.  The
red box simply plays the ACTS tones into the telephone microphone.
ACTS hears those tones, and allows you to place your call.  The actual
tones are:
</p> <pre>
Nickel Signal      1700+2200  0.060s on
Dime Signal        1700+2200  0.060s on, 0.060s off, twice repeating
Quarter Signal     1700+2200  33ms on, 33ms off, 5 times repeating
</pre> <p>
Canada uses a variant of ACTSD called N-ACTS.  N-ACTS uses different
tones than ACTS.  In Canada, the tones to use are:
</p> <pre>
Nickel Signal      2200hz       0.060s on
Dime Signal        2200hz       0.060s on, 0.060s off, twice repeating
Quarter Signal     2200hz       33ms on, 33ms off, 5 times repeating
</pre>

<a name="b02">2. How do I build a Red Box?</a>
</p> <p>
Red boxes are commonly manufactured from modified Radio Shack tone
dialers, Hallmark greeting cards, or made from scratch from readily
available electronic components.
</p> <p>
To make a Red Box from a Radio Shack 43-141 or 43-146 tone dialer, open
the dialer and replace the crystal with a new one. The purpose of the
new crystal is to cause the * button on your tone dialer to create a
1700Mhz and 2200Mhz tone instead of the original 941Mhz and 1209Mhz
tones.  The exact value of the replacement crystal should be 6.466806 to
create a perfect 1700Mhz tone and 6.513698 to create a perfect 2200mhz
tone.  A crystal close to those values will create a tone that easily
falls within the loose tolerances of ACTS. The most popular choice is
the 6.5536Mhz crystal, because it is the easiest to procure.  The old
crystal is the large shiny metal component labeled "3.579545Mhz."  When
you are finished replacing the crystal, program the P1 button with five
*'s.  That will simulate a quarter tone each time you press P1.

</p> <p> </p> <hr> <p>

<a name="b03">3. Where can I get a 6.5536Mhz crystal?</a>
</p> <p>
Your best bet is a local electronics store.  Radio Shack sells them,
but they are overpriced and the store must order them in.  This takes
approximately two weeks.  In addition, many Radio Shack employees do
not know that this can be done.
</p> <p>
Or, you could order the crystal mail order.  This introduces Shipping
and Handling charges, which are usually much greater than the price of
the crystal.  It's best to get several people together to share the
S&H cost.  Or, buy five or six yourself and sell them later.  Some of
the places you can order crystals are:

<a name="b04">4. Which payphones will a Red Box work on?</a>
</p> <p>
Red Boxes will work on telco owned payphones, but not on COCOT's
(Customer Owned Coin Operated Telephones).
</p> <p>
Red boxes work by fooling ACTS (Automated Coin Toll System) into
believing you have put money into the pay phone.  ACTS is the
telephone company software responsible for saying "Please deposit XX
cents" and listening for the coins being deposited.
</p> <p>
COCOT's do not use ACTS.  On a COCOT, the pay phone itself is
responsible for determining what coins have been inserted.

</p> <p> </p> <hr> <p>

<a name="b05">5. How do I make local calls with a Red Box?</a>
</p> <p>
Payphones do not use ACTS for local calls.  To use your red box for
local calls, you have to fool ACTS into getting involved in the call.
</p> <p>
One way to do this, in some areas, is by dialing 10288-xxx-xxxx.  This
makes your call a long distance call, and brings ACTS into the
picture.
</p> <p>
In other areas, you can call Directory Assistance and ask for the
number of the person you are trying to reach.  The operator will give
you the number and then you will hear a message similar to "Your call
can be completed automatically for an additional 35 cents."  When this
happens, you can then use ACTS tones.

</p> <p> </p> <hr> <p>

<a name="b06">6. What is a Blue Box?</a>
</p> <p>
Blue boxes use a 2600hz tone to size control of telephone switches
that use in-band signalling.  The caller may then access special
switch functions, with the usual purpose of making free long distance
phone calls, using the tones provided by the Blue Box.

</p> <p> </p> <hr> <p>

<a name="b07">7. Do Blue Boxes still work?</a>
</p> <p>
This FAQ answer is excerpted from a message posted to Usenet by
Marauder of the Legion of Doom.
</p> <pre>
Somewhere along the line I have seen reference to something
similar to "Because of ESS Blue boxing is impossible".  This is
incorrect.  When I lived in Connecticut I was able to blue box
under Step by Step, #1AESS, and DMS-100.  The reason is simple,
even though I was initiating my call to an 800 number from a
different exchange (Class 5 office, aka Central Office) in each
case, when the 800 call was routed to the toll network it would
route through the New Haven #5 Crossbar toll Tandem office.  It
just so happens that the trunks between the class 5 (CO's) and
the class 4 (toll office, in this case New Haven #5 Xbar),
utilized in-band (MF) signalling, so regardless of what I
dialed, as long as it was an Inter-Lata call, my call would
route through this particular set of trunks, and I could Blue
box until I was blue in the face.  The originating Central
Offices switch (SXS/ESS/Etc..) had little effect on my ability
to box at all.  While the advent of ESS (and other electronic
switches) has made the blue boxers task a bit more difficult,
ESS is not the reason most of you are unable to blue box.  The
main culprit is the "forward audio mute" feature of CCIS (out of
band signalling).  Unfortunately for the boxer 99% of the Toll
Completion centers communicate using CCIS links, This spells
disaster for the blue boxer since most of you must dial out of
your local area to find trunks that utilize MF signalling, you
inevitably cross a portion of the network that is CCIS equipped,
you find an exchange that you blow 2600hz at, you are rewarded
with a nice "winkstart", and no matter what MF tones you send at
it, you meet with a re-order.  This is because as soon as you
seized the trunk (your application of 2600hz), your Originating
Toll Office sees this as a loss of supervision at the
destination, and Mutes any further audio from being passed to
the destination (ie: your waiting trunk!).  You meet with a
reorder because the waiting trunk never "hears" any of the MF
tones you are sending, and it times out.  So for the clever
amongst you, you must somehow get yourself to the 1000's of
trunks out there that still utilize MF signalling but
bypass/disable the CCIS audio mute problem.  (Hint: Take a close
look at WATS extenders).

<a name="b08">8. What is a Black Box?</a>
</p> <p>
A Black Box is a resistor (and often capacitor in parallel) placed in
series across your phone line to cause the phone company equipment to be
unable to detect that you have answered your telephone.  People who call
you will then not be billed for the telephone call.  Black boxes do not
work under ESS.

<a name="b10">10. What is an ANAC number?</a>
</p> <p>
An ANAC (Automatic Number Announcement Circuit) number is a telephone
number that plays back the number of the telephone that called it.
ANAC numbers are convenient if you want to know the telephone number
of a pair of wires.

</p> <p> </p> <hr> <p>

<a name="b11">11. What is the ANAC number for my area?</a>
</p> <p>
How to find your ANAC number:
</p> <p>
Look up your NPA (Area Code) and try the number listed for it. If that
fails, try 1 plus the number listed for it.  If that fails, try the
common numbers like 311, 958 and 200-222-2222.  If you find the ANAC
number for your area, please let us know.
</p> <p>
Note that many times the ANAC number will vary for different switches
in the same city.  The geographic naming on the list is not intended
to be an accurate reference for coverage patterns, it is for
convenience only.
</p> <p>
Many companies operate 800 number services which will read back to you
the number from which you are calling.  Many of these require navigating
a series of menus to get the phone number you are looking for.  Please
use local ANAC numbers if you can, as overuse or abuse can kill 800 ANAC
numbers.

An non-800 ANAC that works nationwide is 404-988-9664.  The one catch
with this number is that it must be dialed with the AT&T Carrier
Access Code 10732.  Use of this number does not appear to be billed.

numbers may vary from switch to switch within the same city.

<a name="b12">12. What is a ringback number?</a>
</p> <p>
A ringback number is a number that you call that will immediately
ring the telephone from which it was called.
</p> <p>
In most instances you must call the ringback number, quickly hang up
the phone for just a short moment and then let up on the switch, you
will then go back off hook and hear a different tone.  You may then
hang up.  You will be called back seconds later.

</p> <p> </p> <hr> <p>

<a name="b13">13. What is the ringback number for my area?</a>
</p> <p>
An 'x' means insert those numbers from the phone number from which you
are calling.  A '?' means that the number varies from switch to switch
in the area, or changes from time to time.  Try all possible
combinations.
</p> <p>
If the ringback for your NPA is not listed, try common ones such as
951-xxx-xxxx, 954, 957 and 958.  Also, try using the numbers listed for
other NPA's served by your telephone company.
</p> <p>
Note: These geographic areas are for reference purposes only.  Ringback
numbers may vary from switch to switch within the same city.

Loops are a pair of phone numbers, usually consecutive, like 836-9998
and 836-9999.  They are used by the phone company for testing.  What
good do loops do us?  Well, they are cool in a few ways.  Here is a
simple use of loops.  Each loop has two ends, a 'high' end, and a
'low' end.  One end gives a (usually) constant, loud tone when it is
called. The other end is silent.  Loops don't usually ring either.
When BOTH ends are called, the people that called each end can talk
through the loop.  Some loops are voice filtered and won't pass
anything but a constant tone; these aren't much use to you.  Here's
what you can use working loops for:  billing phone calls!  First, call
the end that gives the loud tone.  Then if the operator or someone
calls the other end, the tone will go quiet.  Act like the phone just
rang and you answered it ... say "Hello", "Allo", "Chow", "Yo", or
what the fuck ever.  The operator thinks that she just called you, and
that's it!  Now the phone bill will go to the loop, and your local
RBOC will get the bill!  Use this technique in moderation, or the loop
may go down.  Loops are probably most useful when you want to talk to
someone to whom you don't want to give your phone number.

<a name="b16">16. What is a CNA number?</a>
</p> <p>
CNA stands for Customer Name and Address.  The CNA number is a phone
number for telephone company personnel to call and get the name and
address for a phone number.  If a telephone lineman finds a phone line
he does not recognize, he can use the ANI number to find it's phone
number and then call the CNA operator to see who owns it and where
they live.
</p> <p>
Normal CNA numbers are available only to telephone company personnel.
Private citizens may now legally get CNA information from private
companies.  Two such companies are:
</p> <pre>
Unidirectory    (900)933-3330
Telename        (900)884-1212
</pre> <p>
Note that these are 900 numbers, and will cost you approximately one
dollar per minute.
</p> <p>
If you are in 312 or 708, AmeriTech has a pay-for-play CNA service
available to the general public.  The number is 796-9600.  The cost is
$.35/call and can look up two numbers per call.
</p> <p>
If you are in 415, Pacific Bell offers a public access CNA service at
(415)705-9299.
</p> <p>
If you are in Bell Atlantic territory you can call (201)555-5454 or
(908)555-5454 for automated CNA information.  The cost is $.50/call.

</p> <p>
In the following listings, "xxx" means that the same number is used as a
constantly busy number in many different prefixes.  In most of these,
there are some exchanges that ring busy and some exchanges that are in
normal use.  *ALWAYS* test these numbers at least three times during
normal business hours before using as a constantly busy number.

<a name="b22">22. What is scanning?</a>
</p> <p>
Scanning is dialing a large number of telephone numbers in the hope
of finding interesting carriers (computers) or tones.
</p> <p>
Scanning can be done by hand, although dialing several thousand
telephone numbers by hand is extremely boring and takes a long time.
</p> <p>
Much better is to use a scanning program, sometimes called a war
dialer or a demon dialer.  Currently, the best war dialer available to
PC-DOS users is ToneLoc from Minor Threat and Mucho Maas.  ToneLoc can
be FTPed from <a href="ftp://ftp.paranoia.com/pub/toneloc">ftp.paranoia.com</a>.
</p> <p>
A war dialer will dial a range of numbers and log what it finds at
each number.  You can then only dial up the numbers that the war
dialer marked as carriers or tones.

<a name="b23">23. Is scanning illegal?</a>
</p> <p>
This FAQ answer is excerpted from <em>2600</em>, Spring 1990, Page 27.
</p> <pre>
In some places, scanning has been made illegal.  It would be hard,
though, for someone to file a complaint against you for scanning since
the whole purpose is to call every number once and only once.  It's
not likely to be thought of as harassment by anyone who gets a single
phone call from a scanning computer.  Some central offices have been
known to react strangely when people start scanning.  Sometimes you're
unable to get a dialtone for hours after you start scanning.  But
there is no uniform policy.  The best thing to do is to first find out
if you've got some crazy law saying you can't do it.  If, as is
likely, there is no such law, the only way to find out what happens is
to give it a try.
</pre> <p>
It should be noted that a law making scanning illegal was recently
passed in Colorado Springs, CO.  It is now illegal to place a call
in Colorado Springs without the intent to communicate.

<a name="b25">25. What are the DTMF frequencies?</a>
</p> <p>
DTMF stands for Dual Tone Multi Frequency.  These are the tones you
get when you press a key on your telephone touchpad.  The tone of the
button is the sum of the column and row tones.  The ABCD keys do not
exist on standard telephones.

[2]      - indicates that you are not local and maybe how to reach you
[3]      - found in Pac Bell territory; Intercom ring causes a distinctive
           ring to be generated on the current line; Hold keeps a call
           connected until another extension is picked up
[4]      - applied once before each call
[5]      - A.C.R. blocks calls from those who blocked Caller ID
           (used in C&P territory, for instance)
[6]      - cancels further return attempts
[7]      - *82 (1182) has been mandated to be the nationwide code for
           "Send CLID info regardless of the default setting on this
           phone line."
[M: *xx] - alternate code used for MLVP (multi-line variety package)
           by Bellcore. It goes by different names in different RBOCs.
           In Bellsouth it is called Prestige. It is an arrangement of
           ESSEX like features for single or small multiple line groups.

           The reason for different codes for some features in MLVP is that
           call-pickup is *8 in MLVP so all *8x codes are reassigned *5x

<a name="b29">29. What is Caller-ID?</a>
</p> <p>
This FAQ answer is stolen from Rockwell.
</p> <p>
Calling Number Delivery (CND), better known as Caller ID, is a
telephone service intended for residential and small business
customers.  It allows the called Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) to
receive a calling party's directory number and the date and time of
the call during the first 4 second silent interval in the ringing
cycle.
</p> <h2> Parameters </h2>
The data signalling interface has the following characteristics:
<pre>
Link Type:                              2-wire, simplex
Transmission Scheme:            Analog, phase-coherent FSK
Logical 1 (mark)                        1200 +/- 12 Hz
Logical 0 (space)                       2200 +/- 22 Hz
Transmission Rate:                      1200 bps
Transmission Level:                     13.5 +/- dBm into 900 ohm load
</pre>
<h2> Protocol </h2>
The protocol uses 8-bit data words (bytes), each bounded by a start
bit and a stop bit.  The CND message uses the Single Data Message
format shown below.
<pre>
| Channel  |  Carrier  |  Message  |  Message  |  Data       | Checksum |
| Seizure  |  Signal   |  Type     |  Length   |  Word(s)    | Word     |
| Signal   |           |  Word     |  Word     |             |          |
</pre>
<h2> Channel Siezure Signal </h2>
The channel seizure is 30 continuous bytes of 55h (01010101) providing
a detectable alternating function to the CPE (i.e. the modem data
pump).
<h2> Carrier Signal </h2>
The carrier signal consists of 130 +/- 25 mS of mark (1200 Hz) to
condition the receiver for data.
<h2> Message Type Word </h2>
The message type word indicates the service and capability associated
with the data message.  The message type word for CND is 04h
(00000100).
<h2> Message Length Word </h2>
The message length word specifies the total number of data words to
follow.
<h2> Data Words</h2>
The data words are encoded in ASCII and represent the following
information:
<ul> <li> The first two words represent the month
<li> The next two words represent the day of the month
<li> The next two words represent the hour in local military time
<li> The next two words represent the minute after the hour
<li> The calling party's directory number is represented by the remaining
words in the data word field </ul>
<p> </p>
If the calling party's directory number is not available to the
terminating central office, the data word field contains an ASCII "O".
If the calling party invokes the privacy capability, the data word
field contains an ASCII "P".
<h2> Checksum Word </h2>
The Checksum Word contains the twos complement of the modulo 256 sum
of the other words in the data message (i.e., message type, message
length, and data words).  The receiving equipment may calculate the
modulo 256 sum of the received words and add this sum to the reveived
checksum word.  A result of zero generally indicates that the message
was correctly received.  Message retransmission is not supported.
<h2> Example CNS Single Data Message </h2>
An example of a received CND message, beginning with the message type
word, follows:
<pre>
04 12 30 39 33 30 31 32 32 34 36 30 39 35 35 35 31 32 31 32 51

04h=  Calling number delivery information code (message type word)
12h=  18 decimal; Number of data words (date,time, and directory
      number words)
ASCII 30,39= 09; September
ASCII 33,30= 30; 30th day
ASCII 31,32= 12; 12:00 PM
ASCII 32,34= 24; 24 minutes (i.e., 12:24 PM)
ASCII 36,30,39,35,35,35,31,32,31,32= (609) 555-1212; calling
      party's directory number
51h=  Checksum Word
</pre>
<h2> Data Access Arrangement (DAA) Requirements </h2>
To receive CND information, the modem monitors the phone line between
the first and second ring bursts without causing the DAA to go off
hook in the conventional sense, which would inhibit the transmission
of CND by the local central office.  A simple modification to an
existing DAA circuit easily accomplishes the task.
<h2> Modem Requirements </h2>
Although the data signalling interface parameters match those of a
Bell 202 modem, the receiving CPE need not be a Bell 202 modem.  A
V.23 1200 bps modem receiver may be used to demodulate the Bell 202
signal.  The ring indicate bit (RI) may be used on a modem to indicate
when to monitor the phone line for CND information.  After the RI bit
sets, indicating the first ring burst, the host waits for the RI bit
to reset.  The host then configures the modem to monitor the phone
line for CND information.
<h2> Signalling </h2>
According to Bellcore specifications, CND signalling starts as early
as 300 mS after the first ring burst and ends at least 475 mS before
the second ring burst
<h2> Applications </h2>
Once CND information is received the user may process the information
in a number of ways.
<ol> <li> The date, time, and calling party's directory number can be
displayed.
<li> Using a look-up table, the calling party's directory number can be
correlated with his or her name and the name displayed.
<li> CND information can also be used in additional ways such as for:
   <ol> <li> Bulletin board applications
   <li> Black-listing applications
   <li> Keeping logs of system user calls, or
   <li> Implementing a telemarketing data base </ol> </ol>
<h2> References </h2>
For more information on Calling Number Delivery (CND), refer to
Bellcore publications TR-TSY-000030 and TR-TSY-000031.

<a name="b31">31. What is a PBX?</a>
</p> <p>
A PBX is a Private Branch Exchange.  A PBX is a small telephone switch
owned by a company or organization.  Let's say your company has a
thousand employees.  Without a PBX, you would need a thousand phone
lines.  However, only 10% of your employees are talking on the phone
at one time.  What if you had a computer that automatically found an
outside line every time one of your employees picked up the telephone.
With this type of system, you could get by with only paying for one

<a name="b32">32. What is a VMB?</a>
</p> <p>
A VMB is a Voice Mail Box.  A VMB is a computer that acts as an
answering machine for hundreds or thousands of users.  Each user will
have their own Voice Mail Box on the system.  Each mail box will have
a box number and a pass code.
</p> <p>
Without a passcode, you will usually be able to leave messages to
users on the VMB system.  With a passcode, you can read messages and
administer a mailbox.  Often, mailboxes will exist that were created
by default or are no longer used.  These mailboxes may be taken over
by guessing their passcode.  Often the passcode will be the mailbox
number or a common number such as 1234.

<a name="b33">33. What are the ABCD tones for?</a>
</p> <p>
The ABCD tones are simply additional DTFM tones that may be used in any
way the standard (0-9) tones are used.  The ABCD tones are used in the
U.S. military telephone network (AutoVon), in some Automatic Call
Distributor (ACD) systems, for control messages in some PBX systems, and
in some amateur radio auto-patches.
</p> <p>
In the AutoVon network, special telephones are equipped with ABCD keys.
The ABCD keys are defined as such:
</p> <pre>
A - Flash
B - Flash override priority
C - Priority communication
D - Priority override
</pre> <p>
Using a built-in maintenance mode of the Automatic Call Distributor
(ACD) systems once used by Directory Assistance operators, you could
connect two callers together.
</p> <p>
The purpose of the Silver Box is to create the ABCD tones.

<a name="b34">34. What are the International Direct Numbers?</a>
</p> <p>
The numbers are used so that you may connect to an operator from a
foreign telephone network, without incurring long distance charges.
These numbers may be useful in blue boxing, as many countries still have
older switching equipment in use.
