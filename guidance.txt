                    Guidance On Software Maintenance


                 Roger J. Martin  and  Wilma M. Osborne


             This report addresses issues and problems of  software
             maintenance  and suggests actions and procedures which
             can help software maintenance organizations  meet  the
             growing  demands of maintaining existing systems.  The
             report establishes a working definition  for  software
             maintenance   and  presents  an  overview  of  current
             problems  and  issues  in  that   area.    Tools   and
             techniques  that may be used to improve the control of
             software maintenance activities and  the  productivity
             of  a software maintenance organization are discussed.
             Emphasis is placed on the need for  strong,  effective
             technical   management   control   of   the   software
             maintenance process.



             Key   words:    adaptive   maintenance;     corrective
             maintenance;    management;   perfective  maintenance;
             software engineering;  software maintenance;  software
             maintenance management;  software maintenance tools.
