0.0 Intro

Well, finally I decided to take 15 minutes out of my life and write a paper
on proxy servers. I have answered tons of mail,posts etc on how to hide your
IP while exploring the Internet . So here it is... some BASIC info on proxies......

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0 What is a proxy server

Proxy Server is a  firewall and cache server. It allows and entire network of 
computers to access the internet(http or ftp)with a single IP. Let's say we 
have 3 computers in some small network in Malaysia going through a proxy 
server:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> PROXY SERVER -> THE WEB SITE

Now assume you are at home with an Internet access through your ISP, this is
what your connection looks like :

Your PC -> Your ISP -> THE WEB SITE

Ok, now.... If the proxy server in the network above allows other users to go
through it we can to this :

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> PROXY SERVER -> THE WEB SITE
                 |
                 |
Your PC -> Your ISP 

As you can see in the above diagram we can go through that proxy server and
hide our real IP ! "THE WEB SITE" will only see the proxies IP of the network
you are going through..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 Why use one

That was mentioned before, to hide your REAL IP. But, some of the proxies can
give out/forward your real IP to the site you are connecting to and do infact
log their users.Hmmm, well there is a problem that was discovered while
attempting a phf exploit on a site. As it turns out, proxy servers with the
Squid Cache forward you real IP upon a request, but to my knowledge some do not
log their users. Here are two sites for testing proxies :

http://www.tamos.com/bin/proxy.cgi

http://kyticr.kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd

If you see your IP in any of the two URL's -> your proxy sucks, get a new one.

1.2 How to find one

Ez way : Visit wwwboard related to hacking/cracking/warez/phreaking and
         look at the IP's of the parties that post there and write them 
         down. (many of them will spoof their IP)

Ez way2: ask others

Harder : Domain Scan for open ports 8080,3128.

V Hard : ping host.com:8080 or 3128

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3 How to configure one in your browser

In I.E :

View -> Internet Options -> Connection

Now type in the IP of the proxy and try connecting to it through port
8080,80,3128


Netscape (from memory):

Preferences -> Network -> Proxy tab

Same as in I.E
