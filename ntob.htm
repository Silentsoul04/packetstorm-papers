To Hugh Lynn, without whom this never would have gotten started. To Terry
Tucker, without whose inspiration this would not be what it is. To Larry
Miner, without whose indulgence this would never have been finished. To Jim
Plaisted, Laura Picon, Mel Hoeferlin, Dave Hensley, and Dan O'Connor, without
whose kind words this would not have been as well-aimed. To Larry Yelowitz
and DoctorDave Gobuty, without whose pressure the diamond might not be so
pure. To Steve Job, for making Apple what it was. And, of course, to Mom
and PoP.

  <STRONG>Foreword</STRONG>
</H2>
<P>
This book was started to serve as a text from which to teach an introductory
course in Computer Security. As the writing progressed, it became apparent
that more depth was needed than a simple introductory course would
entail&Auml;and&Auml;that the work would need to serve those people not taking
the course. I sincerely hope that this helps you as much as it was intended
to. 
<P>
  <HR>
<H1 align="center">
  <STRONG>Introduction</STRONG>
</H1>
<P>
This book was written to help reduce the onslaught of information available
in the field of operational computer security to manageable proportions and
to help make sense of the process needed to correctly determine the level
of computer security needed for a specific program. There are four major
groups of intended readers who can gain from the use of this text.
<P>
<B>Active COMPUSEC Professionals:</B> Those who regularly work with COMPUSEC
issues will find that this book works quite nicely to bring together, in
a manageable size, the gems from a shelf full of reference publications.
After all, who can remember it all, all of the time; paper was invented so
people could forget. Also, this book should help to locate that fine nuance
which is "in one of those books over there" but eludes capture on the tip
of the tongue at the moment.
<P>
<B>Novice COMPUSEC Professionals:</B> Those who have only recently begun
to work the COMPUSEC issues will find that this book helps to point out what
they don't know and then take a good stab at filling the void, to working
levels at least.
<P>
<B>COMPUSEC-Associated Professionals:</B> For the mass of people who work
in association with COMPUSEC professionals, especially on a program which
has COMPUSEC as a significant portion of the effort, this book serves to
enlighten without wasting an inordinate amount of time.
<P>
<B>COMPUSEC Unknowns:</B> For those who aren't sure whether their program
requires active computer security measures, this book serves to point out
what there is to be gained by COMPUSEC in an integrated security engineering
effort.
<P>
<EM><B>NOT The Orange Book</B></EM> is not intended to replace the Rainbow
Series or the associated publications produced by other governmental bodies.
Rather it seeks to point the way in a shorter and simpler format. But, just
as Cliff Notes are not the same as the classics covered by them, there is
still a need, at times, to read the full text of the standard documents.
Neither is this book intended to replace the engineering process (or the
thought process) in determining the computer security requirements. The use
of this book has been envisioned in the following ways. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<B>Table of Contents:</B> The table of contents is written in the Old Style,
with major topics within the section included in the table itself. If a
particular topic is in question, between the titles and the topics, the
appropriate section should be able to be found with little difficulty. If
it is certain that the full text is going to be needed for close scrutiny,
the entry includes the title, number, and color (if a Rainbow Member) of
the unDigested document.
<P>
<B>Defining the System: </B>A guided tour of the thought processes and basic
algorithms involved seeks to help the Reader to determine the level of computer
security needed for the particular system and its environment. As a part
of this process the tradeoffs which need to be considered between computer
security and the other securities are discussed.
<P>
<B>Spare Parts Bin:</B> In the various portions of this section are the spare
parts needed to specify the requirements and task the work effort and
documentation for the various levels of computer security.
<P>
<B>Digests: </B>Each of the digests uses the information in the Table of
Contents, with amplification, as a header and follows with the highlights
from the particular book. If the digest leaves questions unanswered, going
to the full text is probably in order.
<P>
<B>Case Studies: </B>Through the use of several case studies (at high levels
of abstraction) the Reader may be able to focus the other information and
tools discussed and provided by this book.
<P>
<B>Glossary:</B> There are two "Glossaries" in this book. The first is the
digest of TG-004, the second is a glossary of the terms which need definition
in this book. While it would have been nice to have only one glossary, that
would have required deletion of TG-004 (not good for completeness) or the
inclusion of terms in the TG-004 digest which are not in TG-004 (not good
for purity.)

<P>
As the Information Age progresses, the reliance on computers is increasing
at a steady pace. Along with this reliance comes an ever increasing need
to apply the standard management practices, which are a part of the rest
of our lives, to computers. Security has long been a standard management
practice which now needs to make its way into the management of computer
systems too. People who would never leave their office unlocked will leave
their computer modem activated without a second thought. People who would
never hand over their checkbook will leave their financial data on a diskette
unprotected. The same people who would never hand out the combination to
their safe will resist the use of password protection on a computer with
the same information stored. Security must be part and parcel of a computer
system, and it must be built into the system with minimum negative impact
and maximum return on the investment.
<H3>
  System Security Engineering Management
</H3>
<P>
The security aspects of a program are maintained and nourished through Systems
Security Engineering Management as set forth in MIL-STD-1785. Systems Security
Engineering covers the entire spectrum of security activities with an integrated
approach that allows for methodical and comprehensive coverage of the security
effort.
<P>
<U><B>Systems Security Engineering as a Part of Systems Engineering</B></U>
<P>
Through the Systems Engineering discipline, Systems Security Engineering
in general, and Computer Security (CompuSec) in particular, can be accomplished
in an efficient and orderly manner. The iterative analytical techniques which
are so much a part of the Systems Engineering process are totally applicable
to the requirements definition for the Systems Security Engineering process
as well. Top level functions still decompose into lower level functionality.
The design tradeoffs and requirements analysis are still studied, interpreted,
and selected in the same manner. MIL-STD-1785 gives the tasks to be performed
and their sequencing; Systems Engineering gives the methodology to accomplish
the tasking.
<P>
<U><B>Computer Security Engineering as a Part of Systems Security
Engineering</B></U>
<P>
Though only lightly touched upon in MIL-STD-1785, computer security (CompuSec)
is an integral part of system security engineering for programs which incorporate
computers processing sensitive data. Due to the ever increasing storage capacity,
processing power, and transmission rates, damages and losses from computers
have become a very real concern across the whole of society. An entire
briefcaseful of classified data will fit on a single diskette. The average
computer heist is orders of magnitude greater than the average bank robbery.
Because computers operate so much faster than humans, the computer must handle
a significant portion of the security.
<P>
<U><B>The "Securities"</B></U>
<P>
Systems Security Engineering is concerned with a group of security disciplines
which are interrelated and have significant overlap in the protection given
against various vulnerabilities. Each must be considered, along with its
strengths and weaknesses during system requirements definition and development.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <B>Information Security (INFOSEC):</B> Concerned with access to information
  without regard to the form of the information. (Closely related to CompuSec
  with a large area of overlap.)
  <P>
  <B>Physical Security:</B> Concerned with physical access to the protected
  resources. (Locks, doors, fences, and guards.)
  <P>
  <B>Computer Security (CompuSec):</B> Concerned with regulating and recording
  access to computer resources and the data residing in the computer.
  <P>
  <B>Personnel Security:</B> Concerned with the verified "Goodness" of the
  personnel involved with a system (Clearances).
  <P>
  <B>Product Security:</B> Concerned with the security of the "product" during
  the manufacturing process. (A CompuSec concern for Configuration Management
  and Trusted Distribution)
  <P>
  <B>Industrial Security:</B> Concerned with the developing contractors' security
  aspects and activities. (Higher Industrial Security is one way to lower CompuSec
  requirements.)
  <P>
  <B>Operations Security (OPSEC):</B> Concerned with operational information
  and the restricting of data to the appropriate personnel. (Loose Lips )
  <P>
  <B>Communications Security (COMSEC):</B> Concerned with the secure communications
  and cryptographical aspects. (Often lumped with CompuSec and called INFOSEC.)
  <P>
  <B>Emanations Security (EMSEC, Tempest):</B> Concerned with stray electronic
  impulses and the ability to use them to derive useful information.
  <P>
  <B>Administrative Security (Procedural Security):</B> Concerned with the
  procedures used to provide for security. (Hand-written audit trails,
  Administrative restriction to a given security level on a given machine,
  Two-Man rule, etc.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<U><B>System Accreditation</B></U>
<P>
No matter what kind of computer system is being developed, there will be
someone (or some agency), responsible for allowing the system to operate
with the data needed. This someone, the accreditor {or Designated Approving
Authority (DAA), or any number of other names depending on the system} looks
at the entire system and all of the securities and evaluates the interactions
to determine the overall security suitability of the total system. Early
and active involvement of the DAA in the development of the requirements
and the system design is necessary to the development of a secure system
which will be allowed to operate, as planned, when finished.
<P>
<U><B>Security After Deployment</B></U>
<P>
Whatever security is designed and built into the system during development
must take into account the security measures which will be implemented after
system deployment. Computer security measures require action from a security
person at least on a part-time basis and, for larger systems, teams of security
personnel are needed full time. In addition, the various implementation levels
for physical security and personnel security can either raise or lower the
necessary security measures which need to be incorporated into the computer
system itself. (Obviously the security measures for an Automatic Teller Machine
(ATM) are radically different than the measures for the bank's mainframe
computer.) Security measures considered during design and development must,
therefore, take into account usability and personnel availability as well
as other security measures which may modify the security needs of the computer
system itself.

  Determining the System's Security Needs
</H3>
<P>
In order to levy appropriate CompuSec requirements and task the developing
contractor properly, it is first necessary to determine the types of security
needed and the levels of security for each type needed. This book does not
seek to fully define the levels of security for all of the "Securities" -
just identify the tradeoffs which can be made between the "Securities" and
then fully define the level of CompuSec needed for a given set of assumptions
about the system, its environment, and its capabilities.
<P>
<U><B>Threats and Vulnerabilities =&gt; Risks</B></U>
<P>
The purpose of the CompuSec requirements and tasking levied on a system is
to lower the risks of the system. Risks occur when a threat finds a vulnerability
to attack. By reducing either the threat or the system's vulnerability to
the threat, the risk is reduced.
<P>
<B>Vulnerabilities:</B> Vulnerabilities can be grouped into two main categories
for CompuSec purposes; the system itself and the data which is stored, processed,
and/or transmitted by the system.
<P>
The computer portion of the system itself is relatively fragile by nature
and is susceptible to system shutdown or slowdown without very much effort
on the part of the threat. Even a relatively small degradation in performance
is sufficient to cause the system to become effectively worthless. In addition,
the typical non-embedded system is a high dollar value piece of equipment
which is always a favorite target.
<P>
The data used within the system is obviously a target for the threats to
the system. After all, the manipulation of the data is why the computer system
is being developed. Whether classified or not, the data is needed by the
user of the system or it should not be on the system. Any data that is needed
by the user is also needed by those Not So Friendly people in the world and/or
the Not So Friendlies would like to see the data not be available to the
user.
<P>
<B>Threats:</B> Threats to a system come in a wide variety of shapes and
sizes. An airborne system has the threat that it might fall to Earth. A ground
based system has the threat of power surges during a thunder storm. Either
of these threats can effectively deny the user the use of the system and
its data without any malicious intent on the threats part. In addition, there
are indeed Not So Friendly people out there who will want a system and its
data, either for their own or to deny the use of the system to the user.
Each threat must be considered for each system, though the nature of the
system will limit the viable threats somewhat. (Computer Centers rarely suffer
from bird strikes and crash from the sky.)
<P>
<B>Risks:</B> When the Vulnerable assets of a system are subject to targeting
by the Threats to the system, Risk of Bad Things happening is present. The
point behind the CompuSec engineering effort is to reduce the risks to an
acceptable level so that the Bad Things won't happen beyond the system's
level to cope with them. (Because the Bad Things for one system are different
than the Bad Things for another system, the Approach to determining the needs
for a system is the purpose of this section.)
<P>
<U><B>Sharing the Security Needs or"CompuSec and the Securities"</B></U>
<P>
Theoretically the computer system could be built which would allow anyone,
even Not So Friendly folk, to sit down at the terminal and have an acceptable
level of risk. In fact, this is essentially the case for the network of ATMs
raising its head all over the place. This is not, however, the optimum situation
for most systems. Through a well-reasoned engineering trade-off process,
a suitable mix of the securities can be found which will minimize performance
degradation and cost while remaining in the realm of well understood techniques
and well within the state-of-the-art (and probably within the
state-of-the-technology.)
<P>
<B>Performance Considerations:</B> Whatever security measures are levied
on the system will have some effect on the performance of the system. In
the case of the ATMs, ease of use is reduced by the need to have the Card
and the limited functionality of the available options. If human intervention
is required for each access to data, the queue will build to intolerable
levels for an active system. Requiring the system to maintain security labels
on each subject and object within the system will add unnecessary throughput
to a system which operates at a single security level. A facility entry system
which backs-up the personnel around the block at shift change is most probably
counter-productive. Some of the basic trade-offs between CompuSec and the
other Securities are:
<P>
<B><I>Layered Physical Security</I></B> will allow for more ready access
to the terminals for a limited set of users, provided that the Physical Security
measures are sized properly for the actual traffic flow. The Physical Security
tends to be manpower intensive and or to use emerging technology which will
add another set of CompuSec concerns regarding the computer that runs the
physical security. In most instances, some level of Physical Security will
be required.
<P>
When control over the users is possible, <B><I>Personnel Security</I></B>
can reduce the level of CompuSec required. Unfortunately, operational
considerations do not always allow for sufficient controls to be placed on
the personnel. The ultimate case in point is the ATM Network, but, in this
day and age of multinational cooperation, the limiting of personnel to US
nationals goes out the window when the system is sold through Foreign Military
Sales (FMS). The limiting of personnel to relatively high clearance levels
will add to the lifecyle cost of the system unless the users are, by the
nature of their duties, already cleared to the required level.
<P>
While labor-intensive, <B><I>Procedural Security</I></B> can solve many
"unsolvable" situations. The system operators must have the ability to circumvent
the normal operations of the system in order to perform some of their tasks
- Procedural Security is the answer. Overuse of this technique will limit
the ability of the "watchers" to watch effectively, and the higher the use
the higher the problem of watching the watchers grows.
<P>
Intelligent use of these securities will allow for a greater degree of trust
to be granted the system's software through development by cleared personnel
and configuration management throughout the life of the system, including
upgrades. All of those little devils like Trojan Horses, Viruses, Logic Bombs,
Worms, etc. will be greatly reduced, and possibly stopped, through careful
application of <B><I>Administrative, Product, and Industrial
Securities</I></B>.
<P>
<B>Costs:</B> Additional requirements, of any kind, add to the development
cost of a system. In some cases, though, the lifecycle cost will be lower
because of the increased requirements. The following are some of the aspects
of the cost of the requirements that need to be considered.
<P>
Because the majority of the CompuSec requirements are realized in software,
the development cost of CompuSec requirements are substantial. To some degree
these costs can be lowered through the purchase of COTS systems from the
National Computer Security Center's (NCSC) Evaluated Product List (EPL) for
the appropriate level of security. The other securities are typically realized
as hardware subsystems and as operational procedure manuals. Depending on
the level of security required, these can be COTS turnkey systems and procedures
which are simple and straight forward. In the extreme case, the requirements
can represent a major development effort in their own right.
<P>
The payoff for the expense in development is that if the computer performs
a function, a person does not need to. CompuSec requirements which are executed
properly reduce the manpower needed for the life of the system. The personnel
needs linked to Physical Security are high and the Administrative Security
methodologies also are labor intensive. Personnel Security can become
prohibitively expensive in more resources than mere money if the required
clearance levels grow too far beyond the minimum necessary in an effort to
simplify the security requirements in other security disciplines.
<P>
<B>Level of Understanding:</B> Of all of the security disciplines which are
managed by System Security Engineering Management, CompuSec is probably the
least well understood. While there is nothing especially difficult about
CompuSec, its relative newness leads to misunderstandings concerning its
requirements which would not happen in another discipline. Because of this
low misunderstanding threshold, any requirements which are leveled in the
CompuSec arena must be stated in the clearest form possible and monitored
closely to ensure proper execution.
<P>
<B>Do-Ability:</B> In conjunction with the generally low level of understanding
of the CompuSec discipline, the do-ability of CompuSec functionality bottoms
out in much shallower water than with functionality that is better understood.
The state-of-the-art for CompuSec is not on a par with the
state-of-the-technology for other aspects of systems development. Each time
a CompuSec requirement is levied it must be carefully examined to ensure
the do-ability.
<P>
<U><B>Yellow Books (I &amp; II)</B></U>
<P>
The Yellow Books are members of the Rainbow Series put out by the NCSC. (Actually
they are CSC-STD-003-85 and CSC-STD-004-85. Digests of these two standards
can be found in Section III: Rainbow Readers' Digest.) The sole purpose of
these two documents is to give a standard method for determining the needed
Orange Book Class for a given system with its given set of circumstances.
The approach taken by the Yellow Books is conceptually simple: take the level
of data on the system and compare it to the clearances of the people with
access to the system. The greater the difference between the lowest cleared
person and the highest level of data, the higher the risk. The following
steps are taken to quantify this risk.
<P>
<B>Minimum User Clearance Rating (RMin):</B> Through the use of the table
in the Yellow Books, a numeric rating is given to the clearance of the lowest
cleared personnel who will have access to the system. This number will be
between 0 (Uncleared, without access to Sensitive Unclassified Information)
and 7 (TS/SBI with access to Multiple Categories of TS Data).
<P>
<B>Maximum Data Sensitivity Rating (RMax):</B> Through the use of the appropriate
table in the Yellow Books, a numeric rating is given to the sensitivity of
the most sensitive data operated on by the system. The number will be between
0 (Unclassified) and 7 (TS with two or more categories of Secret or TS data).
<P>
<B>Risk Index:</B> The Risk Index is computed by subtracting the RMin from
the RMax. When a non-positive (zero or negative) value is the result {all
users cleared to equal to or higher than all of the data}, the Risk Index
is 1 if there are any categories to which any user does not have access and
0 otherwise. When a positive value is the result, the Risk Index is that
result.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (<STRONG>Risk Index = RMax - RMin</STRONG>)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Modes of Operation:</B> The CompuSec requirements for a system vary with
the mode of operation and the controls that are necessary to allow for operation
in that mode. There are four recognized modes of operation for secure computer
systems. Each of these modes has its own environment in which to operate
and conditions that indicate its use.
<P>
The <B><I>Dedicated Mode</I></B> of operation is indicated for a system when
each user has clearance for all of the data on the system, formal access
to all of the data, and a valid need-to-know for all of the data.
<P>
The system <B><I>high mode</I></B> of operation is indicated for a system
when each user has clearance for all of the data on the system and formal
access to all of the data on the system, but not all of the users have a
valid need-to-know for all of the data on the system.
<P>
The <B><I>compartmented mode</I></B> of operation is indicated for a system
when each user has clearance for all of the data on the system but not all
users have formal access or a valid need-to-know for all of the data on the
system.
<P>
The <B><I>multilevel mode</I></B> of operation is indicated for systems where
not every user has clearance for all of the data on the system, formal access
to all of the data on the system, or a valid need-to-know for all of the
data on the system.
<P>
<B>Development Environment:</B> Malicious logic planted by the developers
during development is almost impossible to find until it is too late. When
a system is developed by personnel who are verified to not be Not So Friendly
People the system can be trusted to act in the manner in which it was designed
(at least more so than a system which may have been developed by malicious
programmers.) Because of this, the Yellow Books allow for less stringent
CompuSec requirements when the system is developed in a closed environment
than if it is developed in an open environment.
<P>
There are two required conditions for a Closed Development Environment, both
of which must be met, to qualify a development environment as Closed.
<P>
<B>Developers:</B> The developers must have clearances and authorizations
equal to the data which will be processed by the system, or at least Secret
clearance for systems that will process data at or above Secret. (This is
to reduce the risk of malicious logic being inserted by the developers.)
<P>
<B>Configuration Control:</B> Configuration control must be sufficient to
ensure no malicious logic is inserted after development.
<P>
If either of the above conditions are not met, the development environment
is Open. It should be noted that most COTS systems are developed in an Open
Environment. (In fact, most commercial vendors fail both conditions).
<P>
<B>Orange Book Class:</B> Now that the Risk Index, Mode of Operation, and
Development Environment type have been selected/defined for the system, the
Orange Book Criteria Class needed for the system can be determined. The actual
CompuSec requirements and tasking are based upon the Orange Book Class indicated.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <B>C1:</B> Provides for nominal Discretionary Access Control (DAC).
  <P>
  <B>C2:</B> Provides for more finely grained DAC, auditing, and accountability
  through individual login procedures.
  <P>
  <B>B1:</B> Additionally provides for Mandatory Access control (MAC), an informal
  policy model, and export labeling.
  <P>
  <B>B2:</B> Additionally provides for a formal model, covert channel analysis,
  a structured Trusted Computing Base (TCB), and stringent Configuration
  Management.
  <P>
  <B>B3:</B> Additionally provides for a small TCB which contains only security
  policy enforcement functions, a separate security administrator function,
  and all accesses to objects are to be mediated.
  <P>
  <B>A1:</B> Functional requirements are the same as B3. Additionally provides
  for formal design specification and verification techniques and more stringent
  documentation and Configuration Management requirements.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<U><B>Lowering the CompuSec Needs</B></U>
<P>
Now that the various trade-off options have been discussed and an initial
Orange Book class has been identified with the Yellow Books, the iterative
process of tuning the system operational concept to lower the CompuSec needs
begins. The following areas are the primary areas where progress can be made
in this effort.
<P>
<B>Classified Needs:</B> The assumed classified needs of the system should
be reviewed to ensure the validity of each level of classified or sensitive
data. In some instances, the data requirements of the system could be satisfied
with a lower level of data which can materially lower the level of CompuSec
requirements. Nice-To-Haves aren't so nice when they get to be expensive.
<P>
<B>Operational Personnel:</B> If the system concept calls for most of the
operational personnel to be cleared to Level X and a few to be cleared only
to the lower Level Y, it should be investigated whether the few can be reasonably
cleared to Level X as well. If, on the other hand, only a few of the personnel
are cleared (conceptually) to Level X, it should be investigated whether
the Level X personnel (and the Level X data) could be segregated into a subsystem
of the total system which is not accessible to the Level Y personnel.
<P>
Environmental Considerations: The net effects of the other securities should
be reviewed to tune the trade-offs on iteration of the security requirements
definition. In some instances, slightly raising the other Securities'
requirements will greatly lower the CompuSec requirements. In other cases,
it may become clear that relieving the other Securities of some of their
requirements will have no negative impact on the system because CompuSec
is going to need to cover that aspect of security anyway.
<H3>
  Statement of Work (SOW) Issues
</H3>
<P>
As the Class of requirements increases, the documentation requirements and
other tasks also increase. By the time that the jump from B3 to A1 comes
along, the only changes are to the tasking and documentation; the functional
requirements are identical. This part of the book will supply the Spare Parts
and "installation instructions" for the SOW.
<P>
There are some decisions to be made for the specific program in question;
these decisions will be discussed in the Format Considerations portion. The
impacts of the decisions are subtle, but, like much subtlety, the effects
can be truly insidious.
<P>
System Security Engineering Management (SSEM), as set forth in MIL-STD-1785,
covers a broad range of security disciplines which includes computer security.
The SSEM Program portion shows the paths which will help the program arrive
at the appropriate destination for the system. It is especially important
that the other securities neither wash out the computer security nor allow
the computer security to wash them out.
<P>
The Documentation portion gives a guided tour of the various documents which
are peculiar to, or measurably altered by, computer security.
<P>
The Tasks portion breaks the tasks into digestible chunks and presents them
by Orange Book Class. The final arrangement in the SOW will be based on the
decisions which need to be made with the help of the Format Considerations
portion presented earlier in the SOW part and as modified by the SSEM program
portion.
<H3>
  Format Considerations
</H3>
<P>
The formatting of the tasking within the SOW can have impacts beyond the
surface impression. The continuity of the security effort and the cost of
that effort are both affected by the layout of the tasking as well as the
reporting of the effort and its costs. The decision must be made early in
order to have the security built into the program instead of a Johnny-Come-Lately
effort tacked on to the main effort after it is too late to achieve much
more than expensive Lip Service.
<P>
<U><B>Separate WBS Item / Scattered Throughout </B></U>
<P>
At the lower extreme, the C1 Class systems require very little in the way
of special requirements or extra documentation. For such systems there is
no need to have a special niche set in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
for the CompuSec effort.
<P>
On the other hand, the A1 Class systems have such intensive requirement sets,
software proofs, and documentation that the set of activities represents
a significant portion of the overall effort for the system. For such systems
there is a definite need to elevate security in general, or CompuSec in
particular, a relatively high niche in the WBS for reporting purposes and
to give a unified front for the related, and interdependent, activities involved
in the design and development of an A1 Class system.
<P>
Now that the decisions for the extremes are taken care of, consideration
must be given to the middle ground. The relative scale and scope of the CompuSec
effort as a portion of the total effort will be the primary determining factor
for a given system. Secondary considerations are the relative awareness of
the CompuSec arena by the contractor personnel involved and the relative
newness of the techniques which are planned to be used. A relatively high
level WBS element dedicated to the CompuSec effort will generally lead to
a CompuSec "office" within the contractor with the charge of monitoring the
implementation of the requirements and handling the documentation requirements.
<P>
<U><B>Cost Quality Oversight Perceived Importance</B></U>
<P>
The higher the level of the WBS element for CompuSec is defined, the finer
the detail cost accounting for the CompuSec effort will be. This is, of course,
the way the WBS works. In conjunction with the finer detail of the cost
accounting, the actual cost will also tend to rise with the level of the
WBS. More management emphasis and a higher level manager to manage the effort
equate to more effort expended and more effort expended equates to higher
cost for the CompuSec effort.
<P>
With the higher level of management attention, the quality of the work performed
tends to improve somewhat. If the tasking is scattered about the system effort
the tendency exists for the CompuSec portion of the effort to get slighted
in favor of the "Real Effort". As the effort is drawn together, the "Real
Effort" becomes the CompuSec effort. This results in a more concerted effort
and trade-offs being made which favor the being viewpoint (at least part
of the time.)
<P>
Along with the cost visibility comes overall program oversight of the effort
both on the part of the contractor and the government. This improved oversight
of the effort can result in great savings because the CompuSec arena is not
well understood for the most part. As time marches on and more contractors
(and government personnel) become experienced with CompuSec the great need
for special oversight will wane, but, for now, the greater the oversight
the better. In addition to the direct government oversight, if the contractor
has a cadre of experienced personnel, the CompuSec "office" at the contractor
can serve as an Internal Independent Verification and Validation (IIV&amp;V)
team. Of course, the usual problems related to IIV&amp;V will still exist;
the reporting chain will not reach high enough, the IIV&amp;V personnel will
be pulled to perform Software Engineering at the drop of a schedule, etc.
For a time, the visibility and oversight will be improved greatly.
<P>
The single greatest reason for elevating the level of the WBS element for
the CompuSec effort is the perceived importance of the effort by the contractor.
The contractor is resource limited. The areas which are perceived as being
important to the government will receive the higher priorities in the allocation
of resources. If the CompuSec effort is perceived as being of low importance,
the resources allocated will be low priority resources.
<H3>
  System Security Engineering Management Program
</H3>
<P>
The System Security Engineering Management (SSEM) Program is called for by
MIL-STD-1785. While the CompuSec portion of the SSEM Program is the primary
emphasis of this book, the Program as a whole needs to be examined to determine
the appropriate way to task the portions.
<P>
<U><B>The Securities</B></U>
<P>
Each of the Securities mentioned earlier in this Section are covered by SSEM.
For any given program, some, all, or none of the securities will have minimal
impact or import. Each must be examined and the appropriate measures, studies,
etc. must be taken to counter the threats. For the most part, the measures
to be taken will take the form of support subsystems and/or procedural and
administrative measures. By the start of Engineering and Manufacturing
Development (EMD), and the writing of the EMD SOW, the appropriate tasking
should be clear for each of the securities. The SSEM Program should cover
the group as a whole with separate sections as needed for the actual design
and implementation.
<P>
<U><B>Oversight of Program</B></U>
<P>
In order to maintain an appropriate level of oversight by the government,
it is a good idea to levy the SSEM Program Management tasks as one of the
direct tasks under System Engineering. This allows the tasks to receive the
proper attention by the proper personnel. Within the SSEM PM section, the
various securities can be broken out as needed.<U></U>
<P>
<U><B>Industrial Security and the Rest</B></U>
<P>
One care that should be taken is to ensure that none of the securities ride
rough-shod over the others. (Yes, that includes CompuSec) Another security
which tends to grow a life of its own is Industrial Security. While definitely
needed, Industrial Security should be kept well separated from the rest of
the securities (except perhaps Product Security). A good model for a program
which includes a fairly stiff CompuSec effort would be; System Engineering
=&gt; SSEM =&gt; Industrial Security, CompuSec, The Other Securities.<U></U>
<H3>
  Documentation
</H3>
<P>
Along with the functional requirements for each of the Classes of secure
computer systems come documentation requirements. In some cases, the
documentation needs closely parallel the standard documentation (users guides,
etc.) and these needs can be filled by replacement or modifications to the
standard documents. In other cases, the CompuSec documents have no equivalent
document (<EM>Formal Top Level Specification</EM>, <EM>Computer Security
Policy Model</EM>, etc.).
<P>
<U><B>For Itself</B></U>
<P>
Some of the CompuSec documentation is needed because the document produced
is needed by the operators of the system. For instance, the user's manuals,
especially the <EM>Security Features Users Guide</EM>, are needed to allow
the full and efficient use of the secure system as designed and built. On
the other hand, the security test documentation and the covert channel analysis
are needed by the security personnel to help circumvent penetration attempts
during the operational phase of the system lifecycle. While these documents
are not part of the standard documentation package for most systems, they
are essential to the ultimate security of the system.
<P>
<U><B>For Oversight Effort</B></U>
<P>
Other documents in the package are for program oversight purposes. For instance,
the <EM>Computer Security Policy Model</EM> is used as an intermediate document
to ensure the correct interpretation and implementation of the <EM>Computer
Security Policy</EM>. While these documents serve no innate long term purpose,
the long term effects of not having the documents are massive. Because the
CompuSec arena is not well understood and the vocabulary is basically unstable,
there is an increased need for the contracting agency to maintain good oversight
of the contractor's effort (and for the contractor to do the same).
<P>
<U><B>Pertinent Documents</B></U>
<P>
Because the documents are not those typically used for most programs, here
is a list of the basic documents and their descriptions in order to help
familiarize the reader with the terrain when the SOW tasking, CDRL, and tailored
DIDs portions are reached.
<P>
<B>System Security Engineering Management Plan:</B> This is the cornerstone
document for the security engineering effort. In it the contractor lays out
the plan for managing the entire security engineering effort. Along with
the other securities comes CompuSec and the plans to interpret, allocate,
and implement CompuSec requirements and taskings. The document usually works
best when detailed plans are given for the next phase of the program and
broad plans are given for the remainder of the program. Updates at the beginning
of each phase will then allow for the each layer of detailed planning to
be based on a firm understanding of the approaches being taken. This is the
document which will allow the government to gain confidence in the contractor's
understanding of the tasking and requirements in a timely manner.
<P>
<B>Computer Security Management Plan:</B> This Plan is a CompuSec specific
offshoot of the SSEM Plan. Here the detailed plans for CompuSec are laid
out in excruciating detail. This allows the contractor and the government
to ensure the understanding of the effort by the team which will actually
be performing the tasking. On a large program with an intensive security
engineering effort both documents are needed to allow for the varying levels
of abstraction involved. On a smaller program, or a program with less intensive
security needs, one or the other of the documents should be sufficient by
itself.
<P>
<B>Security Vulnerability Analysis (SVA):</B> The SVA is generated during
Concept Exploration and updated during Dem Val. By the time that FSD rolls
around the SVA is complete and is used by the designers to determine the
appropriate implementations to counter the vulnerabilities.
<P>
<B>Computer Security Policy:</B> The Policy contains the stated rules and
assumptions under which the system will be built and function. Some of the
topics covered would be the assumed level of personnel that will operate
the system, the mode of operation for the system, whether Mandatory Access
Control will be used, and the assumed operational environment for the system.
The Policy really should be written by the government but typically it is
left to the contractor to determine the Policy for the system, which works
well if the government takes an active role in the approval process.
<P>
<B>Computer Security Policy Model:</B> This is the bridging document between
the <EM>Policy</EM> and the requirements. Depending on the Class of the system
the model is either a formal mathematical model or an informal English language
descriptive model. While the Model tends to be a good-sized document it should
be given close attention to ensure complete understanding of the
<EM>Policy</EM> by the contractor.
<P>
<B>Security Concept of Operations:</B> This is the "Artists Rendition" of
the CompuSec arena. This is where the conceptual implementation of the Policy
is laid out and the interplay of the various Securities is discussed. This
document should be written for the ease of understanding by the non-Security
professional. This is the probable source (along with the <EM>Policy</EM>)
for the inputs to the Yellow Books in the determination of the needed Class
of security requirements and tasking for the system.
<P>
<B>Security Architecture Study:</B> This study covers the finer details of
the security architecture after the initial determination of the needed Class
has been made. The results can result in changes in the needed Class through
reallocation to the Other Securities.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  NOTE: The <EM>Policy</EM>, <EM>SVA</EM>, <EM>Model</EM>, <EM>Security</EM>
  <EM>Con</EM> <EM>Ops</EM>, and <EM>Security</EM> <EM>Architecture</EM>
  <EM>Study</EM> are developed and finalized around the same time period and
  are iteratively developed as the interdependencies and repercussions of the
  decision process are felt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Covert Channel Analysis Report:</B> This report is mandated for systems
at or above Class B2. The methods of passing data outside normal, controlled
channels are analyzed and any which are of sufficient bandwidth are studied
for elimination/minimization purposes.
<P>
<B>Computer Security Audit Analysis:</B> This analysis is performed on a
recurring basis to trace the implementation of the audit trail requirements.
Understanding of the contractor approach and realization of the requirements
can be gained as well as the impacts of the audit process in processor
throughput, network bandwidth availability, and storage space required. The
periodic release is needed because the actual system performance costs continue
to become more finely defined as the implementation approaches completion.
<P>
<B>Security Features Users Guide (SFUG):</B> This is the guide to understanding
the functionality of the security features, their interactions, and guidelines
for their use. For the lower Classes of systems, the SFUG can be a section
of the users' manual but as the classes grow, so does the SFUG. Whenever
possible, the SFUG should be a free-standing document for ease of use (and
finding it).
<P>
<B>Trusted Facility Manual:</B> This manual covers the duties and roles of
the security related positions on the system. The manual is sometimes realized
as Positional Handbooks for each of the positions with the pertinent details
needed for each position in its own Handbook. If realized as a single volume,
the details for each position related to the security implementation needs
to be present.
<P>
<B>Descriptive Top Level Specification (DTLS):</B> Starting at the B2 Class,
the DTLS describes the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) in intimate detail,
especially the TCB interface.
<P>
<B>Formal Top Level Specification (FTLS):</B> This is an A1 Class required
document that is the formal (mathematical) brother of the DTLS. The FTLS
must be produced with a endorsed formal specification system and must be
mapped to the code of the TCB.
<P>
<B>Security Test Documentation:</B> Security test documentation serves two
purposes: during development and test the documentation is used for the separate
testing of the security features to ensure the security of the system. The
documentation is then maintained to allow for retesting after modifications
and updates to the system and for the use of the security personnel in the
evaluation of the risks related to proposed changes to the systems and its
environment.
<P>
<B>Security Test Plan:</B> The test plan, like most test plans, covers the
Big Picture without going into great detail. It is the best view of the testing
effort, though, and can be quite useful for gaining insight into the security
implementation.
<P>
<B>Security Test Procedures:</B> The procedures, like most procedures, are
excruciatingly detailed directions for the test itself. Where these test
procedures differ is the pointing away from simple requirement satisfaction
and more toward security satisfaction.
<P>
<B>Security Test Report:</B> The test report is the results of the testing
and should be maintained through the life of the system to ensure continued
protection and to document flaws which may exist.

<P>
In <U><B>Section I: Building a Secure System</B></U> the determination of
the appropriate Class of secure system was made. In addition, the pros and
cons of SOW and WBS options were discussed and decisions were to be made
based on the particular system being developed. Also, a list of pertinent
documents were discussed for the CompuSec arena.
<P>
In <U><B>Section II: Spare Parts</B></U> the pieces are listed which can
be put together to form the CompuSec portions of the specification, SOW,
and CDRL for the system in question. The section is broken into parts based
on the Class of system determined in Section I. For each of the Classes from
C1 through A1, the requirements, SOW tasking, and CDRL inputs are listed.
<P>
<B>Requirements:</B> The requirements are laid out as a separate appendix
to the specification. While this is not intensely needed for the lower Classes,
by the time that the B-level Classes are reached, the requirements are involved
enough to necessitate the creation of a separate appendix.
<P>
<B>SOW Tasking:</B> The SOW portion is composed of paragraphs which will
need to be arranged in the SOW in accordance with the decisions, made in
Section I, concerning SOW formatting.
<P>
<B>CDRL Inputs:</B> The CDRL input section gives essentially all of the
document-specific except for the distribution section which will need to
be determined for each system individually.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  NOTE -- The Tasking and CDRL inputs are not separated by phase. If the program
  has clear phases, some of the tasks and documentation will need to be tailored
  accordingly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Following the portions concerned with the various Classes of systems, there
is a portion containing the major Data Item Descriptions (DID). In some cases
there will be a need to tailor the DIDs. Such tailoring should be performed
only with the greatest of care.
<P>
Two things to remember when using these Spare Parts are:
<P>
These are the basic minimums for a generic system. For your specific system
there may be portions which just do not apply and there may be portions which
need to be added.
<P>
Nothing replaces careful thought and consideration.

  C1 Class
</H3>
<P>
The C1 class secure computer system is the lowest level of CompuSec<STRONG>
</STRONG>requirements defined by the Orange Book. C1 class systems are
appropriate for operation in the dedicated mode of operation only. The
protections are not sufficient to protect against an internal attack.
<P>
There are a limited number of high level subjects and objects which are protected
at all and the limits on the sharing of objects are not restrictive.
<P>
The users are required to login but the system does not need to be able to
identify individual users uniquely. This implies that group logins (or project
logins) are allowed.
<P>
The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is required to protect itself (software)
for outside interference and tampering and to be able to validate the operations
of the TCB hardware and firmware.

  C2 Class
</H3>
<P>
The C2 class secure computer system enforces a more finely grained DAC than
C1 class systems do. C2 class systems are appropriate for operation in the
dedicated or system high modes of operation only. The protections include
individual accountability.
<P>
There are a limited number of high level subjects and objects which are
protected. Propagation of access rights is controlled. Access is controlled
at the granularity of named individual and/or group of named individuals.
<P>
The users are required to login and the system needs to be able to identify
individual users uniquely. While individuals are individuals, group access
rights are still allowed.
<P>
Reuse of storage objects (memory, disk space, buffers, etc.) is only allowed
after the object is cleared to disallow any access to the old data.
<P>
Audit is required to make users responsible for their actions. Half of the
theory behind audits is to allow for the security personnel to find wrongful
acts and identify the perpetrator; the other half of the theory is that an
advertised audit process will keep Honest people Honest.

  B1 Class
</H3>
<P>
The B1 class secure computer system enforces a Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
policy and the associated labeling. B1 class systems are appropriate for
operation in the compartmented and multilevel modes of operation. Multilevel
mode operations should be carefully considered before use because there is
no protection from covert channel attacks.
<P>
There are a limited number of high level subjects and objects which are protected
by DAC. Propagation of access rights is controlled. Access is controlled
at the granularity of named individual and/or group of named individuals.
<P>
The users are required to login and the system needs to be able to identify
individual users uniquely. While individuals are individuals, group access
rights are still allowed.
<P>
Reuse of storage objects (memory, disk space, buffers, etc.) is only allowed
after the object is cleared to disallow any access to the old data.
<P>
Audit is required to make users responsible for their actions. Half of the
theory behind audits is to allow for the security personnel to find wrongful
acts and identify the perpetrator; the other half of the theory is that an
advertised audit process will keep Honest people Honest. With labeling and
MAC, the security level is also recorded for objects being audited.
<P>
Labels are required for all subjects and storage objects controlled by the
TCB. These labels are used for MAC decisions which are also mandated for
all subjects and storage objects under TCB control. The basic requirements
are a simple translation of the standard "Paper-style" requirements onto
the computer so the computer will mark and allow access properly.

  B2 Class
</H3>
<P>
The B2 class secure computer system is based on clearly defined security
policy and model of the policy. B2 class systems are appropriate for operation
in the compartmented and multilevel modes of operation. Multilevel mode
operations should be carefully considered before use because there is limited
protection from covert channel attacks.
<P>
There are a limited number of high level subjects and objects which are protected
by DAC. Propagation of access rights is controlled. Access is controlled
at the granularity of named individual and/or group of named individuals.
<P>
The users are required to login and the system needs to be able to identify
individual users uniquely. While individuals are individuals, group access
rights are still allowed.
<P>
Reuse of storage objects (memory, disk space, buffers, etc.) is only allowed
after the object is cleared to disallow any access to the old data.
<P>
Audit is required to make users responsible for their actions. Half of the
theory behind audits is to allow for the security personnel to find wrongful
acts and identify the perpetrator; the other half of the theory is that an
advertised audit process will keep Honest people Honest. With labeling and
MAC, the security level is also recorded for objects being audited.
<P>
Labels are required for all system resources. These labels are used for MAC
decisions which are also mandated for all subjects and storage objects under
TCB control. The basic requirements are a simple translation of the standard
"Paper-style" requirements onto the computer so the computer will mark and
allow access properly.
<P>
The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is required to protect itself (software)
from outside interference and tampering and to be able to validate the operations
of the TCB hardware and firmware.

  A1 Class
</H3>
<P>
The A1 class secure computer system is based on clearly defined security
policy and model of the policy. A1 class systems are appropriate for operation
in the multilevel mode of operation. The functional requirements for A1 are
identical to the requirements for the B3 class system. The increased protection
offered by A1 systems is through increased assurance measures.
<P>
Subjects and objects which are protected by DAC. Propagation of access rights
is controlled. Access is controlled at the granularity of named individual
and/or group of named individuals. The TCB is able to list the groups and
individuals with access to given objects including modes of access allowed
and those individuals and groups with no access allowed to an object. (This
implies, but does not explicitly require, Access Control Lists (ACL).)
<P>
The users are required to login and the system needs to be able to identify
individual users uniquely. While individuals are individuals, group access
rights are still allowed.
<P>
Reuse of storage objects (memory, disk space, buffers, etc.) is only allowed
after the object is cleared to disallow any access to the old data.
<P>
Audit is required to make users responsible for their actions. Half of the
theory behind audits is to allow for the security personnel to find wrongful
acts and identify the perpetrator; the other half of the theory is that an
advertised audit process will keep Honest people Honest. With labeling and
MAC, the security level is also recorded for objects being audited.
<P>
Labels are required for all system resources. These labels are used for MAC
decisions which are also mandated for all subjects and storage objects under
TCB control. The basic requirements are a simple translation of the standard
"Paper-style" requirements onto the computer so the computer will mark and
allow access properly.
<P>
The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is required to protect itself (software)
for outside interference and tampering and to be able to validate the operations
of the TCB hardware and firmware. In addition, the TCB monitors the audit
events to determine if the activity indicates imminent security violations
and alerts the security officer upon occurrence.

  as a proportion of the total system functionality this DID becomes increasingly
  useful. In particular, if the system has security operations as its primary
  function (as in a security add-on subsystem) this is the DID which should
  be used.

  <STRONG>III: Rainbow Readers' Digest</STRONG>
</H2>
<P>
The National Computer Security Center (NCSC) has produced a series of documents
dealing with various aspects of computer security development and operations.
Because the covers of these documents are color-coded, the documents have
come to be known as the Rainbow Series. This Section contains digests of
each of the documents which have been published so far. In addition, there
are a few related documents digested which are not Members of the Rainbow
Series but are of the same genre. The documents in this digest are as follows.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <B>DOD 5200.28-STD DoD Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria: </B>This
  is the keynote document of the series. It covers Fundamental Computer Security
  Requirements, Divisions and Classes of Systems, Testing Guidelines, Commercial
  Product Evaluation, and the Requirements by Class. (Also known as the Orange
  book.)
  <P>
  <B>CSC-STD-002-85 DoD Password Management Guideline: </B>Topics covered include
  Individual Password, Password Change, Password Protection, and Password Length.
  <P>
  <B>CSC-STD-003-85 Computer Security Requirements and CSC-STD-004-85 Rationale
  Behind Computer Security Requirements: </B>These two documents help you calculate
  the appropriate level of Computer Security Requirements for your system.
  The treatment given in each is slightly different, but the answers given
  are essentially the same. Topics covered include Minimum User Clearance (RMin
  ), Maximum Data Sensitivity (RMax ), Risk Index, and Computer Security
  Requirements Class.
  <P>
  <B>CSC-STD-005-85 DoD Magnetic Remanence Security Guideline:</B> (Superseded
  by NCSC-TG-025) The topics covered include Declassification and Clearing,
  Declassification Permission, Properly Functioning Media, Non-functional Media,
  and Destruction. This standard appears to have fallen on hard times as the
  media industry has made such great advances. The basic concepts involved
  are still valid.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-001 A Guide to Understanding Audit:</B> Topics covered include
  Audit Requirements Overview, Audited Events, and Selective Audit. (TG stands
  for Tech Guide.)
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-002 Trusted Product Evaluations A Guide for Vendors:</B> This
  document acclimates the vendor to the evaluation procedures of the NCSC.
  Specific topics include phasing of the evaluation process, technical product
  description, and the legal agreement between NSA and the vendor.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-003 A Guide to Understanding Discretionary Access Control:</B>
  This document covers the ticklish topic of DAC. Specific sub-topics include
  Implementation Methodologies, Control Permission and Access Modes, and
  Requirements.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-004 Glossary of Computer Security Terms</B>
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-005 Trusted Network Interpretation:</B> This document takes a
  look at the Orange Book (which was written in terms of a monolithic computer)
  and "Interprets" the requirements for the network type environment. Topics
  include Security Policy, New Evaluation Areas, Network Components, and Cascading
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-006 A Guide to Understanding Configuration Management:</B> In
  this day and age of viruses and worms there is an even greater need for CM
  than before. The actual CM requirements are not much different than those
  of the typical DoD development. The primary emphasis of this guide was for
  the commercial vendor whose CM practices are often non-existent. Topics include
  Configuration Management (CM) Use, CM Requirements, and CM Tasks.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-007 A Guide to Understanding Design Documentation:</B> This document
  covers the design documentation requirements for each of the classes from
  C1 through A1.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-008 A Guide to Understanding Trusted Distribution:</B> CM covers
  the protection of the system when in the hands of the developers and the
  users. This document covers the protection of the system between them. Topics
  include Trusted Distribution (TD) Assurances, Post-Production Protection,
  and Transit Protection.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-009 Computer Security Subsystem Interpretation:</B> This
  interpretation is for the add-on systems which lend security to a basically
  insecure system. Topics include Required Features, Assurance Requirements,
  and Documentation Requirements.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-011 Trusted Network Interpretation Environments Guideline:</B>
  It is the first of a series of off-shoots of NCSC-TG-005. Topics include
  Network Security Architecture and Design (NSAD), Risk Assessment, and Network
  Security Services.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-013 Rating Maintenance Phase Program (RAMP) Document:</B> The
  current setup for evaluation lists a particular hardware configuration with
  a particular operating system as a particular class. RAMP seeks to extend
  the evaluation listing to future versions of the system. Topics include
  Preevaluation Phase, Vendor Assistance Phase/Design Analysis Phase, Evaluation
  Phase, and Rating Maintenance Phase.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-014 Guidelines for Formal Verification Systems:</B> Topics include
  Endorsement And ETL Listing, Technical factors, Features, Assurance, and
  Required Documentation. Of little interest for most systems.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-015 A Guide to Understanding Trusted Facility Management:</B>
  This is a good background document for gaining an understanding of the basic
  concept for setting up a system. Roles discussed include Security Administrator,
  Secure Operator, Account Administrator, and Auditor.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-017 A Guide to Understanding Identification and Authentication
  in Trusted Systems:</B> This document covers the requirements for I&amp;A
  by class and discusses methods and implementations to meet the requirements.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-019 Trusted Product Evaluation Questionnaire:</B> This document
  serves as a good guide to help the developer ensure that all of the "bases
  are covered". The questionnaire covers the entire gamut of CompuSec issues
  for a system.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-020 Access Control List (ACL) Features for UNIX:</B> The requirement
  to be able to list users with access or not for an object tends to point
  toward ACLs for the DAC implementation. This Guide was written specifically
  for UNIX system developers implementing ACLs, but the though processes and
  rationales involved are of wider validity.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-021 Trusted Database Management System Interpretation of the Trusted
  Computer System Evaluation Criteria:</B> This document covers a broad range
  of topics which have some relation to trusted databases. The total effect
  is close to being a rewrite of the Orange Book while not officially attempting
  to do so.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-025 A Guide to Understanding Data Remanence in Automated Information
  Systems:</B> This document explores each method of clearing and/or purging
  data from media and lists DoD approved methods for each major media type.
  <P>
  <B>NCSC-TG-026 A Guide to Writing the Security Features User's Guide for
  Trusted Systems:</B> This document covers presentation, packaging, and content
  for the SFUG and gives two outline examples of acceptable SFUG styles.
  <P>
  <B>C Technical Report 79-91 Integrity in Automated Information Systems:</B>
  This document addresses the "other half" of COMPUSEC. Along with removing
  the chance for compromise of sensitive data we must also protect the data
  from damage. This is not a full member of the Rainbow Series but instead
  is a Tech Report from the NCSC. Integrity itself plus integrity models,
  implementations, and principles are discussed.
  <P>
  <B>NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1-87 Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation Security:</B>
  This document covers User Responsibilities and Security Officer Responsibilities
  in the office PC-type environment.
  <P>
  <B>MIL-STD 1785 System Security Engineering Program Management:</B> This
  MIL-STD covers the entirety of security engineering and is helpful for the
  phasing aspects and the associated DIDs. The Phases covered include Concept
  Exploration, Demonstration and Validation, Full-Scale Development, Production
  and Deployment.
  <P>
  <B>DRS-2600-5502-86 System High and Compartmented Mode Workstations:</B>
  This is a DIA document from their secure workstation contract. It takes a
  few turns not taken by NCSC. It contains separate sections for the System
  High Requirements and the Compartmented Mode Requirements.

<STRONG>Color:</STRONG> Orange Book
<P>
<STRONG>Date:</STRONG> December 1985
<P>
<STRONG>Highlights:</STRONG> "The provisions of this document apply to DoD
components. This document is mandatory for 'all DoD components in activities
applicable to the processing and storage of classified information'."
<P>
1. Fundamental Computer Security Requirements
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Policy
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Security Policy: There must be an explicit and well-defined security policy
    enforced by the system.
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      a) Mandatory Security Control Objective: The security policy must include
      provisions for enforcing mandatory access control rules based on the
      classification of the information and the user's clearance.
      <P>
      b) Discretionary Security Control Objective: The security policy must include
      provisions for the enforcement of discretionary access control rules based
      on the user's need-to-know for the information.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    2) Marking: Access control labels must be associated with objects.
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      c) Marking Control Objective: The system must store and preserve the integrity
      of labels for all information. Labels exported from the system must be an
      accurate representation of the internal labels being exported.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  b. Accountability
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    d) Accountability Control Objective: The system must ensure individual
    accountability with data usable by a competent agent in a reasonable time
    without undue difficulty.
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      3) Identification: Individual subjects must be identified.
      <P>
      4) Accountability: Audit information must be selectively kept and protected
      so that actions affecting security can be traced to the responsible party.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  c. Assurance
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    e) Assurance Control Objective: The system must accurately implement the
    policy, without distorting the policy's intent, throughout the system's life.
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      5) Assurance: The computer system must contain hardware/software mechanisms
      that can be independently evaluated to provide sufficient assurance that
      the system enforces requirements 1 through 4 above.
      <P>
      6) Continuous Protection: The trusted mechanisms that enforce these basic
      requirements must be continuously protected against tampering and/or unauthorized
      changes.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
2. Divisions and Classes of Systems
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Division D: Minimal Protection - Reserved for those systems which have
  been evaluated but that fail to meet the requirements of a higher evaluation
  class.
  <P>
  b. Division C: Discretionary Protection - Provide for discretionary
  (need-to-know) protection and for accountability of subjects and the actions
  they initiate.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Class C1: Discretionary Security Protection - Incorporate discretionary
    access controls capable of enforcing access limitations on an individual
    basis.
    <P>
    2) Class C2: Controlled Access Protection - More finely grained discretionary
    access control with individual user accountability through login, audit,
    and isolation.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  c. Division B: Mandatory Protection - Enforce mandatory access control rules,
  carry sensitivity labels with major data structures, implement the reference
  monitor concept, and have a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) which implements
  the security policy model.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Class B1: Labelled Security Protection - In addition to C2 features, provide
    informal model, data labeling, mandatory access control, accurate export
    labeling.
    <P>
    2) Class B2: Structured Protection - Provide formal security policy model
    that requires access controls for all subjects and all objects, address covert
    channels, structured into critical and non-critical elements, provide for
    trusted facility management and configuration management.
    <P>
    3) Class B3: Security Domains - Mediate all accesses of subjects to objects,
    have tamperproof TCB which is small enough for analysis and test, provide
    security administrator support, signal security relevant events, securely
    recover the system.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  d. Division A: Verified Protection - Use formal security verification methods
  to assure that the mandatory and discretionary access controls can effectively
  protect the information stored and/or processed. Extensive documentation
  is required to demonstrate the meeting of security requirements in design,
  development, and implementation.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Class A1: Verified Design - {No additional features (over B3).} The system
    has formal design specification, formal verification techniques, formal model
    of the security policy, Formal Top Level Specification, more stringent
    configuration management, and secure distribution of the system to sites.

1. Passwords must be used in conjunction with the UserID for Authenticated
Personal Identification for use in access control and auditing.
<P>
2. GroupIDs are not allowed for authentication purposes (login).
<P>
3. Passwords should be computer generated.
<P>
4. Initial passwords should be dispersed without exposure to the ISSO or
as "expired passwords." (Select from computer real-time-generated list, sealed
carbon paper envelopes, etc.)
<P>
5. User password change should include entering old password to authenticate
the User.
<P>
6. SSO must be able to change anyone's password.
<P>
7. Passwords should be classified at the level of exposure allowed by release
of the password.
<P>
8. Access across networks should be authenticated by 1) Trusted Identification
Forwarding by the "Home" host or 2) UserID and Password to the remote host.
<P>
9. Passwords should be encrypted or DACed or both.
<P>
10. Encryption should include the UserID with the password.
<P>
11. Password guess rate should be limited to approximately one per minute
after a failure on an access port and/or UserID basis.
<P>
12. Failed passwords should have an adjustable alert level to the SSO (about
5).
<P>
13. On successful login the User should be told date and time of last login,
location of last login, and number of unsuccessful attempts since last login.
<P>
14. Password length should be at least:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <U>Log( Password Life x Available Try Rate / Probability of Guess During
  Lifetime)</U>

<P>
<STRONG>Date:</STRONG> 15 NOV 85
<P>
<STRONG>Highlights: </STRONG>No longer in distribution, this document has
been superseded by NCSC-TG-25, A Guide to Understanding Data Remanence.
<P>
1. Declassification of magnetic media is the procedure which renders the
media unclassified and suitable for release. Clearing is the procedure which
removes the data from the media before being stored or rereleased within
a secure environment.
<P>
2. Declassification requires permission from the ISSO. This decision will
be based on:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. The physical media.
  <P>
  b. The criticality of the data previously stored on the media.
  <P>
  c. The procedures performed.
  <P>
  d. A review of the audit of the declassification.
  <P>
  e. An analysis of the risk of incomplete declassification.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
3. For clearing of properly functioning media, one overwrite of each addressable
location with a bit pattern, followed by the pattern's complement is sufficient.
<P>
4. For declassification of properly functioning media, three overwrite cycles
are required. There will be the risk of partially malfunctioning equipment
to factor into the declassification decision.
<P>
5. Non-Destructive Declassification and Clearing of non-functional media
(including malfunctioning) must be accomplished by degaussing with an
NCSC-Approved Degausser.
<P>
6. Malfunctioning Winchester disk drives cannot be declassified for return
to vendor for repair in a non-destructive manner. An (expensive) alternative
is to courier the drive to the vendor and have the platters removed, in the
couriers view, and returned.
<P>
7. Destruction of soft media can be accomplished through incineration or
disintegration.
<P>
8. Destruction of drums and platters can be accomplished through removing
the magnetic media with an emery wheel or a disk sander.
<P>
9. Before release for destruction, the media should be cleared, when possible.
<P>
10. NCSC evaluates and approves degaussers. The latest list of approved
degaussers should be Reviewed before acquisition of new degaussers.

<STRONG>Title:</STRONG> A Guide to Understanding Discretionary Access Control
<P>
<STRONG>Color:</STRONG> Tangerine I
<P>
<STRONG>Date:</STRONG> 30 SEP 87
<P>
<STRONG>Highlights</STRONG>
<P>
1. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is a means of restricting access to
objects based on the identity of subjects and/or their group memberships.
<P>
2. DAC is intended to restrict (and allow) access based on need-to-know.
<P>
3. DAC is generally implemented using one (or more) of five methodologies:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Capabilities: Each user has (or has not) a "capability" to access a specific
  object in a specific mode (Read, Write, etc.). Capabilities can be passed
  to another subject but cannot be altered without TCB intervention. With
  capabilities, it is not possible to determine which users have access to
  specific objects. Group access and revocation of access are a major drawback.
  [User Possessed Token Scheme]
  <P>
  b. Profiles: Each user has a list of allowed objects associated with it.
  This can become a very large and cumbersome table. It is difficult to determine
  which users have access to specific objects. Group access and revocation
  of access are a major drawback. [List of User's Objects]
  <P>
  c. Access Control Lists: Each object to be protected has a list of allowed
  (and disallowed) users associated with it. This can also be implemented with
  groups. If implemented properly, ACLs can meet all classes' requirements.
  [List of Object's Users]
  <P>
  d. Protection Bits: Access is limited based on the access modes allowed for
  the Owner, Group, and World. Protection Bits do not readily support Multiple
  Groups and individual access control.
  <P>
  e. Passwords: The use of a password to gain access to an object can work
  in conjunction with other protections, but the proliferation of the passwords
  leads to unwieldy systems. Passwords are not sufficient protection, but as
  supplemental protection against Trojan Horses, passwords have merit.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
4. The heart of DAC rests with two distinct and preferably separate entities,
control permission and access modes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Control permissions define which subjects have the ability to grant and
  revoke access permissions and change access modes.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Control permissions can limit the control to grant/revoke permission on
    access modes for subjects (Control) or
    <P>
    2) Control permissions can include the passing of the control permission
    to another subject (Control With Passing).
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  b. Implementation of Control Models for DAC are based on the control permissions.
  <P>
  c. The four basic control models for DAC are:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Hierarchical: For a simple example, the system administrator would have
    control with passing to all objects within the system. The system administrator
    would pass control of subsets to the applicable "department heads" who would
    then pass control of subsets to "project heads", etc. Controllers may not
    be the titular heads. Controllers also control their own access modes. (Can
    satisfy all classes.)
    <P>
    2) Ownership: Each object has an "Owner" who controls access to the object.
    Protection bits implement ownership. Administratively, ownership can be
    implemented by the system administrator not passing control permission to
    any subject but the Owner. (Can satisfy all classes.)
    <P>
    3) Laissez-faire: Each subject can pass whatever control permissions and
    accesses the subject has to any other subject, who can then pass them on
    to whoever they desire. Control permissions and access mode control should
    be separate. (Can satisfy all classes. If not separate, does not meet C2.)
    <P>
    4) Centralized: All control permissions rest with one user. Control permissions
    cannot be passed. Control is definite, but could lead to overwork and slowdown
    with large request quantities. (Can satisfy all classes.)
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  d. Access Modes control if and how a subject can use an object. Access modes
  include:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Read: No change allowed.
    <P>
    2) Write-Append: Additions allowed, but no changes and no viewing.
    <P>
    3) Write: Allows modify, add, or delete, but no view.
    <P>
    4) Delete: Deletion, nothing else.
    <P>
    5) Execute: Run an executable object.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  e. Access controls can be levied on directories and/or files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
5. Requirements for C1:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Define and control access between named and objects named users (or named
  groups).
  <P>
  b. Must recognize and control individual objects.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
6. Requirements for C2 through B2:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Include/Exclude access to each object on a per user (or per group) basis.
  <P>
  b. Protection for all objects. (Protection by default for new objects.)
  <P>
  c. Control permissions separate from other access types.
  <P>
  d. Group members uniquely identified.
  <P>
  e. Groups are optional.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
7. Requirements for B3 through A1:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Different access modes are required. (Read, Write, etc.)
  <P>
  b. For each named object, be able to specify named users with access modes
  allowed.
  <P>
  c. For each named object, be able to specify groups with their membership
  and accesses.
  <P>
  d. For each named object, be able to specify named users and groups with
  no access.

<STRONG>Title:</STRONG> Trusted Network Interpretation
<P>
<STRONG>Color:</STRONG> Red I
<P>
<STRONG>Date:</STRONG> 31 JUL 87
<P>
<STRONG>Highlights </STRONG>This book is a rehash of the Orange Book for
networks (in 278 pages). There are several new concepts brought out by the
Red Book; these new concepts are the heart of this Digest.
<P>
1. Security Policy: The network security policy needs two section, in addition
to the sections needed by a system:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Secrecy Policy: The Secrecy Policy defines the policy enforced by the
  network to protect the data on the network from improper exposure to unauthorized
  users.
  <P>
  b. Integrity Policy: The Integrity Policy defines the policy enforced to
  ensure the delivery of unmodified and uncorrupted data from the source to
  the destination.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
2. For networks, several new evaluation areas are brought forth. The criteria
for the evaluations fall into three main areas; Functionality, Strength of
Mechanism, and Assurance. the following is a listing of the new areas to
assess when determining the "Goodness" of a network which were not present
in the assessment of the stand-alone system:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Support Primitives:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Encryption Mechanism.
    <P>
    2) Protocols.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  b. Documentation (needing special attention for networks):
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Security Features User's Guide.
    <P>
    2) Trusted Facility Manual.
    <P>
    3) Test Documentation.
    <P>
    4) Design Documentation.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  c. Communications Integrity:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Authentication.
    <P>
    2) Communications Field Integrity.
    <P>
    3) Non-Repudiation (receipted, guaranteed delivery).
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  d. Denial of Service:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Continuity of Operations.
    <P>
    2) Protocol Based Protection.
    <P>
    3) Network Management.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  e. Compromise Protection:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Data Confidentiality.
    <P>
    2) Traffic Confidentiality.
    <P>
    3) Selective Routing.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
3. Networks are composed of components. While each component need not possess
full security "Goodness", the whole must be able to be judged for overall
"Goodness". The method chosen for systematic evaluation of the components
was to judge each piece by the criteria of one or more slices of the total
security framework. The following is a listing of Component Types and their
Minimum and Maximum Classes:

4. Cascading is the situation where multilevel systems which operate at different
ranges are connected on a multilevel network. While each of the systems in
question have an allowably small range of operation (Confidential through
Secret, Secret through Top Secret, etc.) the network has a larger (and possibly
unacceptable) range of users (Confidential through Top Secret, by the example).
Even when the network only allows Secret transfers, there is the increased
chance that a Confidential who can worm up one level (to Secret) can now
run the net to the Secret-Top Secret system and worm up one more level.

1. Trusted Distribution (TD) gives the following assurances:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Assurance that the product evaluated is the one the manufacturer built.
  <P>
  b. Assurance that the product built is the one sent.
  <P>
  c. Assurance that the product sent is the one the customer site received.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
2. TD is required at the A1 level and higher.
<P>
3. TD should be used at lower levels as cost-effective.
<P>
4. TD should include the documentation.
<P>
5. TD protects against two threats (either of which can introduce Trojan
Horses, trapdoors, viruses, etc.):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Tampering during transit.
  <P>
  b. Counterfeit TCB updates.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
6. TD requires protection during three phases:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Post-Production.
  <P>
  b. Transit.
  <P>
  c. Receipt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
7. Post-production protection and assurance come from the use of packing,
storage, and loading procedures which ensure that the product shipped is
the product intended. This protection and assurance can come from a combination
of one or more of the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Configuration Management procedures.
  <P>
  b. Shrink-Wrap packaging (assuming heat sensitivity allows this).
  <P>
  c. Bonded storage.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
8. In transit protection ensures that what is shipped arrives in an unaltered
state and that what arrives was sent by the purported sender. This assurance
can come from a combination of one or more of the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Shrink-Wrap packaging.
  <P>
  b. Tamper resistant seals.
  <P>
  c. Numbered container seals (with the number sent by separate secure means).
  <P>
  d. Active alarm systems.
  <P>
  e. Couriers.
  <P>
  f. Registered mail
  <P>
  g. Message authentication codes.
  <P>
  h. Encryption.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
9. Receipt verification lends assurance through three main methods:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Confirmation that the methods used previously do not indicate tampering,
  such as Authentication code checks, untriggered alarms, and unbroken seals.
  <P>
  b. Confirmation that the proper parties sent the shipment which has arrived.
  <P>
  c. Independent confirmation that the received TCB is the right TCB. This
  assurance can come from a combination of one or more of the following:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Check-Sum confirmation.
    <P>
    2) Inventory.
    <P>
    3) Technical inspection.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
10. Each case is unique and must be viewed individually to determine the
appropriate TD methods. The active threats against the customer site, the
active threats against the vendor site, and the state-of-the-threat-art must
each be taken into account in determining the cost-effective methods to be
used.

A. Introduction
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  1. For systems which do not have sufficient security there are four recognized
  areas which can be taken care of with "add-on" products:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    a. Discretionary Access Control (DAC).
    <P>
    b. Object Reuse (OR).
    <P>
    c. Identification and Authentication (I&amp;A).
    <P>
    d. Audit (AUD).
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  2. These products, by definition, do not meet all of the requirements for
  a system. The ratings which they are given are based on meeting the subset
  of the requirements pertaining to the area of protection. The ratings given
  are all "D" because of the incompleteness, but the ratings show area compliance
  in the following manner:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    a. D =&gt; Does not meet C1 (DAC, OR, I&amp;A, AUD).
    <P>
    b. D1 =&gt; Meets C1 for the area (DAC, I&amp;A).
    <P>
    c. D2 =&gt; Meets C2 for the area (DAC, OR, I&amp;A, AUD).
    <P>
    d. D3 =&gt; Meets B3 for the area (DAC, AUD).
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  3. In order to have the subsystems have meaning in the total system the necessary
  support from other areas must be present. The basic dependencies are:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    a. DAC requires I&amp;A for ID purposes and AUD (at D2) to track control
    permissions.
    <P>
    b. OR has no dependencies.
    <P>
    c. I&amp;A requires DAC (or domain isolation) and AUD (at D2).
    <P>
    d. AUD requires I&amp;A and DAC (or domain isolation).

TNI. It is the first of a series (within the Rainbow Series) of trusted network
related documents, the Trusted Network Technology (TNT) set.
<P>
2. The areas where the TNI fell down revolve around the following set of
revised definitions which were not used consistently in, or were not properly
brought forth by, the TNI:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Network Trusted Computing Base (NTCB): The totality of protection mechanisms
  within a network system.
  <P>
  b. NTCB Partition: The totality of protection mechanisms within a single
  network subsystem.
  <P>
  c. Component: An individual physical unit that does not provide a complete
  set of end-user services.

  d. The vendor must complete his own RAMP audit to ensure that security feature
  functionality and assurances are being maintained by adherence to the approved
  RM-Plan.
  <P>
  e. The NCSC evaluation team will review the results of the vendor audit to
  ensure the vendor's RAMP process follows the approved RM-Plan procedures.
  <P>
  f. NCSC assigns A Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) and a Business Point
  of Contact (BPOC) before completion of the evaluation phase.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
4. Rating Maintenance Phase
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. The vendor must maintain a responsible corporate officer.
  <P>

  f. The vendor will provide informal quarterly status reports via Dockmaster.
  <P>
  g. The vendor must conduct at least one RAMP audit per RAMP cycle.
  <P>
  h. TPOC will review the vendor's RAMP audit results.
  <P>
  i. The vendor will submit the following documents for each version of the
  evaluated product for which the vendor desires to have the rating maintained
  via RAMP:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Rating Maintenance Report (RMP)
    <P>
    2) Rating Maintenance Plan (RM-Plan) with change bars
    <P>
    3) Final Evaluation Report (FER) with change bars
    <P>
    4) FER with integrated changes
    <P>
    5) Proposed Product description for EPL
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  j. NCSC will review the vendor's documents for the purpose of extending the
  rating to the specific release and placement on the EPL.
  <P>
  k. The vendor's RAMP process is subject to Interim Reviews and Aperiodic
  Reviews by the NCSC to ensure the adherence to the vendor's approved RM-Plan
  procedures.

<STRONG>Title:</STRONG> Access Control List (ACL) Features for UNIX
<P>
<STRONG>Color:</STRONG> Gray
<P>
<STRONG>Date:</STRONG> 18 AUG 89
<P>
<STRONG>Highlights: </STRONG>These are the recommendations for ACL features
for use with UNIX from the Trusted UNIX Working Group (TRUSIX) set up by
the NCSC.
<P>
1. ACLs are required for files, IPC objects, and UNIX system domain sockets.
<P>
2. Access modes required are Read, Write, and Execute.
<P>
3. Each ACL entry should specify permissions for a User XOR a Group.
<P>
4. ACL entry permissions are masked by the group class file protection bits.
<P>
5. Multiple concurrent groups, with group subsetting, should be supported.
<P>
6. Evaluation of ACLs should be (system-defined) from most specific to least
specific. Multiple group permissions should be ORed.
<P>
7. Existing mechanisms should remain as is and used as much as possible.
<P>
8. For new mechanisms which must be added, get/set operations should be used.
<P>
9. Named ACLs are not needed.
<P>
10. Default ACLs should be used along with a user-specifiable Use/No Use
mechanism.
<P>
11. Default ACLs for IPC objects are not recommended.
<P>
12. Default ACLs should be set by directory.
<P>
13. Protection bits are not affected when a new object with default ACL is
created unless an explicit mechanism is provided.

<STRONG>Title:</STRONG> Trusted Database Management System Interpretation
<P>
<STRONG>Color:</STRONG> Lilac
<P>
<STRONG>Date:</STRONG> APR 91
<P>
<STRONG>Highlights: </STRONG>Because the Orange Book was developed with an
atomic system in mind, the advances in computer architectures and designs
has led to discontinuities in the interpretation of the Orange book requirements.
This document covers evaluation by parts and how to deal with the evaluation
of trusted systems which are composed of multiple pieces which individually
enforce policy.
<P>
1. Conditions for Evaluating by Parts
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. TCB subsets are identified.
  <P>
  b. System policy allocated to TCB subsets.
  <P>
  c. Each TCB subset includes all trusted subjects with respect to its policy.
  <P>
  d. Each TCB subset structures or architecture explicitly defined.
  <P>
  e. Each TCB subset occupies distinct subset-domains.
  <P>
  f. More primitive TCB subsets support the less primitive TCB subsets.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
2. Local/Global Requirements: Some requirements can be evaluated completely
within the TCB subset in question (Local), while others deal with interrelations
between TCB subsets (Global). The differentiated requirements follow:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

      a) Models.
      <P>
      b) DTLSs.
      <P>
      c) FTLSs.
      <P>
      d) Non-FTLS internals.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>

<P>
3. Interpretation of the Orange Book Requirements: Some of the requirements
from the Orange Book are interpreted for the context of this document. Those
that are reinterpreted are listed below. (Others which did not require
reinterpretation are not listed here.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Security Policy - Labels
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    General: DBMS objects which require labels include:
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      a) Stored View Definitions
      <P>
      b) Files
      <P>
      c) Records
      <P>
      d) Relations
      <P>
      e) Tuples
      <P>
      f) Directories
      <P>
      g) Schemas
      <P>
      h) Indices
      <P>
      i) Data Dictionaries
      <P>
      j) Discretionary Authorization Tables
      <P>
      k) Recovery Logs
      <P>
      l) Transaction Logs
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    B2: Internal variables within the TCB which are not accessible to untrusted
    subjects do not need to be labelled, but care should be taken to ensure that
    internal variables are not usable for covert channels through the visible
    actions of the variables on the system behavior.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  b. Accountability - Audit
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    General: The emphasis in audit is to provide individual accountability of
    a user's actions. Access (or attempted access) to the protected objects should
    be audited. Internal actions within the TCB subset (DBMS) need not be audited.
    If there are multiple audit logs built correlation methodologies must also
    be present.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    C2: All mediated DAC accesses which are visible to the user must be auditable.
    <P>
    B1: All mediated DAC and MAC accesses which are visible to the user must
    be auditable.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  c. Assurance - System Architecture: Each subset of the TCB must satisfy these
  system architecture requirements.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    C2: Separate execution domain that protects it from interference and tampering.
    <P>
    B2: User interface to be fully defined and all elements of the TCB be identified.
    <P>
    B2: Effectively use available hardware to separate the protection-critical
    portions.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  d. Life Cycle Assurance - Design Specification and Verification
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    B1: An informal argument must be given the the set of formal or informal
    policy models represents the security policy supported by the composite TCB.
    <P>
    B2: An informal argument must be given the the set of formal policy models
    represents the security policy supported by the composite TCB.
    <P>
    B2: Descriptive Top Level Specifications (DTLSs) must be maintained for each
    TCB subset.
    <P>
    B2: DTLS interface descriptions must cover the interfaces between TCB subsets
    as well as the external user interface.
    <P>
    B3: For a convincing argument that the DTLSs are consistent with the Model,
    MAC and DAC access checks at state transitions and visual checking for exceptions
    must be covered for each subset.
    <P>
    A1: Formal Top Level Specifications must be maintained for each TCB subset
    and must cover all facets of the policy (Mac, DAC, etc.)
    <P>
    A1: Each TCB subset must cover the user interface as well as the interfaces
    with other subsets. In addition, there should be a description of how to
    accurately describe the total TCB accurately.
    <P>
    A1: The FTLSs must be shown by formal and informal methods to be consistent
    with the Model; MAC and DAC access checks at state transitions and visual
    checking for exceptions must be covered for each subset.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  e. Documentation - Design Documentation
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    C1: Intermodular interfaces within and between TCB subsets must be described.
    <P>
    B1: The protection mechanisms for each TCB subset must be described and be
    shown to satisfy the model. The protection mechanisms must include the mechanisms
    which support the subset structure and separate subset-domains.
    <P>
    B2: Intermodular interfaces within and between TCB subsets must be described.
    <P>
    B2: DTLS interface descriptions must cover the interfaces between TCB subsets
    as well as the external user interface. In addition, there should be a
    description of how to accurately describe the total TCB accurately.
    <P>
    B2: Each TCB subset must how it implements the reference monitor concept
    within its own technical policy. In addition,there must be a documented informal
    argument that the the cooperative actions of the TCB subsets makes the TCB
    tamper resistant, non-bypassable, and correct.
    <P>
    B2: The documentation for each TCB subset must describe how the subset is
    structured to facilitate testing and enforce least privilege.
    <P>
    B3: Each TCB subset must be informally shown to be consistent with the DTLS.
    <P>
    A1: Each TCB subset must be informally shown to be consistent with the FTLS.

<STRONG>Title:</STRONG> Data Remanence in Automated Information Systems
<P>
<STRONG>Color:</STRONG> Green
<P>
<STRONG>Date:</STRONG> SEP 91
<P>
<STRONG>Highlights:</STRONG> This is an important topic but not covered by
the evaluation process. The document is guidance only and is not meant to
replace policy on the issue. The Degausser Product List (DPL) is included
in the NSA's Information Systems Security Products and Services Catalogue
available through the U.S. Government Printing Office.
<P>
1. Standard Clearing / Purging Methods
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Overwrite: The media is rewritten one or more times with unclassified
  data and/or the bit patterns 0011 0101, 1100 1010, 1001 0111 (HEX: 35, BA,
  97) followed by unclassified data. This must be written to all memory locations
  and the number of repetitions required is based upon the various considerations
  listed. Disk exercisers have many advantages for overwrite including ignoring
  "bad" sectors and variable write frequencies.
  <P>
  b. Degaussing: The media is subjected to a magnetic field to randomly align
  the memory locations. The DPL lists tested degaussing products. Type I Degaussers
  are generally sufficient for Type I Media and Type II Degaussers are generally
  sufficient for Types I &amp; II Media. No Degaussers have been found to be
  sufficient for Type III Media. (If the degausser is malfunctioning or not
  used properly, the results will be unsatisfactory.)
  <P>
  c. Destruction: The recommended destruction methods will remove the risk
  of compromise of sensitive data but they do tend to be a bit hard on the
  media and can be a bit expensive.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Smelting, Disintegration, or Pulverization
    <P>
    2) Incineration
    <P>
    3) Emery Wheel or Disk Sander

<STRONG>Title:</STRONG> System Security Engineering Program Management
Requirements
<P>
<STRONG>Date:</STRONG> 1 SEP 89
<P>
<STRONG>Highlights: </STRONG>
<P>
1. This standard does not come to bear on Computer Security directly; the
primary focus of the standard is Physical Security. The basic plan over the
course of the program lifecycle is sound and if the specifics aren't overly
worried about, the standard can give good guidance for the development of
a COMPUSEC Program or a total System Security Engineering Program. In Particular,
the DIDs which were produced in association with the standard are fairly
good models from which to work the appropriate COMPUSEC DIDs.
<P>
2. The System Security Engineering (SSE) Management Program should:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Enhance the operational readiness and mission success of the defense resource.
  <P>
  b. Identify and reduce potential vulnerabilities to security threats.
  <P>
  c. Provide management information essential to system security planning.
  <P>
  d. Minimize its own impact on program cost and schedule.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
3. The SSE requirements carry through the each program lifecycle phase in
the following way:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Highlights</STRONG>
<P>
1. This document gives the DIA views on the topics basically covered by the
Orange Book for NSA. While not in complete agreement with each other, the
differences between this document and the Orange Book are more in the approach
taken than in goal sought. The largest difference is in the groupings of
requirements. Rather than the six classes (in three divisions) used in the
Orange Book, only two groupings of requirements are made and they are based
on two of the allowed modes of operation, System High and Compartmented.
The requirements are well defined in this document with level of requirement
and alternatives identified in the requirement identifier.

  <STRONG>IV. Case Studies</STRONG>
</H2>
<P>
To help bring the other sections of this book into clear focus, this section
gives four Case Studies of actual systems and their encounters with Computer
Security. In order for the studies to cover as much ground as possible, the
programs included span a wide variety of equipment types and levels of security.
(The names have been changed to protect the innocent and guilty alike.)
<P>
Note: Gonculator translates roughly as Potrezebie.
<P>
A. The New Development Gonculator (NDG) is a current development with massive
integration of the on-board computer systems and uses data with significant
restrictions on its dissemination. The security features concentrate on limiting
data access for personnel with other access to the aircraft.
<P>
B. Upgrade Gonculator (UG) CompuSec is for upgrades to an aircraft which
is also an FMS favorite and thus is not always in the hands of US Nationals.
The security measures concentrate on protecting US-only data and control
code.
<P>
C. Communications Gonculator Group (CGG) is a highly portable communications
network which processes and transmits data at SCI levels while operating
in the System High mode of operations. The security features concentrate
on blocking communications eavesdropping and sudden hardware (involuntary)
turnover.
<P>
D. Ground Intelligence Gonculator System (GIGS) is a bunkered ground station
for a reconnaissance program which processes and transmits intelligence data
at various levels and flavors. The security functionality permeates the system;
it tracks and mediates all access to data and equipment.
<P>
E. Yellow Book Evaluations: Each of the four Gonculator systems is evaluated
per the Yellow Books' (CSC-STD-003-85 and CSC-STD-004-85) algorithms to determine
the "required" Orange Book level for each system, both before and after changes
to allow looser requirements.
<P>

<H3>
  <STRONG>A. NDG: New Development Gonculator</STRONG>
</H3>
<P>
1. Threats: The threats to the NDG can be grouped into three main categories:
threats related to the aircraft sitting on the flight line unattended, threats
related to the aircraft coming down in an unscheduled fashion (crashes),
and the personnel with some level of access to the NDG.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Flight Line: On the flight line the NDG is protected to some degree from
  overt attack by fences and guards, but these measures are not sufficient
  to protect an unattended aircraft from covert attempts to gain access to
  sensitive data held on the aircraft.
  <P>
  b. Fall Down: When the NDG is operating, all possible data must be assumed
  to be available at the time of a crash. The threat inherent in this situation
  is that the aircraft may retain the data after the event. If the event occurs
  in an area populated, or controlled, by Not So Friendly people, this will
  give the Not So Friendlies virtually unlimited time and access to derive
  from the aircraft any data which survived the event.
  <P>
  c. Personnel: Any time that people are involved with data (or data containers)
  there is some level of risk involved. This is fundamental to security in
  general and CompuSec as well (clearances, Need-To-Know, least privilege,
  etc.). In the case of the NDG, there are three levels of personnel with differing
  needs and differing treatments.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Pilot: In order to fly the aircraft to its full capabilities the pilot
    must have access to the sensitive data residing on the aircraft. However
    the access which the pilot requires is not necessarily personal access; most
    of the access required is limited to access by the computers on-board the
    aircraft with the pilot only seeing the results.
    <P>
    2) Special Maintenance: The maintenance personnel who are actively involved
    in the maintenance of the flight computers, sensor systems, data busses,
    etc. have a need for direct access to the data in order to diagnose problems,
    effect repairs on these systems, and load upgrades to the software and data
    stores.
    <P>
    3) Flight Line Maintenance: The other maintenance personnel (servicing the
    engine, fueling the NDG, etc.) don't need the data - just access to the NDG.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
2. Data / Classified Material: Data and code stored and processed on the
NDG run the gamut from unclassified through plain Vanilla Secret to Special
Access Required (SAR) data. Not all of the data is needed by all of the
personnel.
<P>
3. Implementation:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Layered Encryption: Data stored on-board the NDG is encrypted by level
  of data. The mission data cartridge contains the decryption data which allows
  the system to come to full capabilities while loading the mission data. In
  the event of failure of the cartridge, the pilot can key in the decryption
  data to allow the NDG to become fully functional. With the separate encryption
  by level the pilot can generally gain access to what is needed without having
  the data accessible to those who have no need for the data. The maintenance
  personnel have decryption capabilities commensurate with their Need-To-know
  and clearances.
  <P>
  b. Working System Without Decryption: In the event of total decryption failure,
  the NDG is still able to fly the mission. Some of the functionality will
  be impaired by the inaccessibility of portions of the data, by the ability
  to fly and fight will be present.
  <P>
  c. Security As a Compromise With the User: While the security measures taken
  for the NDG do not cover all of the threats fully, the security does cover
  the major problems relatively well and still allows the User to have a system
  which will fill the need. The compromise between mission need and security
  need is always a difficult call to make, but it should be remembered that
  a useless system (through over-securing) is not going to help the security
  situation either.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) While on the flight line, the NDG has no data available for gathering
    by covert means which is not encrypted.
    <P>
    2) In the event that the NDG falls down the RAM is purged by powering down
    the craft, either purposefully or by failure on collision, thus the only
    classified data remaining is in encrypted ROM.
    <P>
    3) The pilots are cleared for the data which is needed to operate the craft
    in a fully functional manner and Identification and Authentication (I&amp;A)
    is accomplished through either Ownership of the mission data cartridge or
    Knowledge of the code to key in for encryption. The special maintenance personnel
    accomplish I&amp;A through various keying procedures and by duplicating,
    for test and diagnostic purposes, the pilots I&amp;A procedures. The other
    flight line personnel have neither the need nor the means to decrypt the
    data.

  <STRONG>B. UG: Upgrade Gonculator</STRONG>
</H3>
<P>
1. Threats: The threats to the UG can be grouped into three main categories:
threats related to the aircraft sitting on the flight line unattended, threats
related to the aircraft coming down in an unscheduled fashion (crashes),
and the personnel with some level of authorized access to the UG. Each of
these threat categories is discussed in the following paragraphs.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Flight Line: On the flight line the UG is protected to some degree from
  overt attack by fences and guards, but these measures are not sufficient
  to protect an unattended aircraft from covert attempts to gain access to
  sensitive data held on the aircraft. In addition to the usual problems associated
  with the flight lines on US bases, the UG is scheduled for sale through the
  FMS program to various foreign countries. The level of flight line physical
  security is subject to the policies and standards of the acquiring country
  - which may or may not always meet the US standards.
  <P>
  b. Fall Down: When the UG is operating, all possible data must be assumed
  to be available at the time of a crash. The threat inherent in this situation
  is that the aircraft may retain the data after the event. If the event occurs
  in an area populated, or controlled, by Not So Friendly people, this will
  give the Not So Friendlies virtually unlimited time and access to derive
  from the aircraft any data which survived the event.
  <P>
  c. Personnel: Any time that people are involved with data (or data containers)
  there is some level of risk involved. This is fundamental to security in
  general and CompuSec as well (clearances, Need-To-Know, least privilege,
  etc.). In the case of the UG, there are three levels of personnel with differing
  needs and differing treatments. The US personnel, the foreign personnel,
  and the contractor field engineers are discussed below.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) US Personnel: The UG is used as a US fighter with US personnel operating
    and maintaining the system. With the data and code stored by UG, the clearing
    all of these personnel is not a problem.
    <P>
    2) Foreign Personnel: Oddly enough, the foreign nationals from the nations
    which buy the UG will also want access to the craft and its data. Unfortunately,
    some of the data is currently not releasable to non-US personnel.
    <P>
    3) Contractor Field Engineers: Along with the UG come the contractor field
    engineers who, among other things, load new versions of the Operational Flight
    Program (OFP) and other control code. These field engineers are cleared US
    citizens.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
2. Data / Classified Material: The data and classified material related to
the UG basically fall into the sets which are discussed in the following
paragraphs:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Unclassified: The majority of the OFP, other code, and stored data is
  unclassified and there is no need to protect the data any more stringently
  than the aircraft will already be protected as the high-value item that it
  is.
  <P>
  b. US - only Weapons and Control Code: Some of the weapons which are available
  for use on the UG system are currently limited to US-only use. There is,
  however, great pressure to sell the FMS customers the "same" system which
  we use - including the US-only weapons and control code.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
3. Implementation: Because this is an UpGrade to an existing system the options
are not as open as they would be in a new development. The previous methods
employed such as distributing just the object code (not the source code)
have not stood the test of reverse-engineering. The contractor field engineers
will continue to load the new versions of the OFP, etc. and additionally
the following steps are being explored and taken as possible:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Downgrading: Where possible, the dissemination-limited data is being
  downgraded to allow for release to the FMS customers. This entails careful
  study and evaluation of the subject material and determining actual risk
  involved with the downgrade.
  <P>
  b. Encryption: Classified data is being encrypted for storage on-board the
  aircraft. This allows for shortened pre-flight preparation while limiting
  the risk of compromise of the data.
  <P>
  c. Don't Disperse Weapons: Those weapons subsystems which are not available
  for the downgrading effort above will not be a part of the FMS purchase packages.
  This does not, however, directly address the question of the control code
  for the weapons - just the weapons themselves.
  <P>
  d. Modularize and Excise: The control code for non-distributed weapons subsystems
  is to be "non-distributed" as well. As a part of the UpGrade, a new mission
  computer system is being installed with an accompanying software rewrite.
  during the rewrite, the code will be modularized with permanent "stub"
  replacements written for those portions of the code which cannot be released
  to non-US personnel. The stubbed version will be compiled for FMS distribution
  and the un-stubbed version will be used for US distribution.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
  <STRONG>C.</STRONG> <STRONG>CGG: Communications Gonculator Group</STRONG>
</H3>
<P>
1. Threats: The threats to the data residing on CGG and transmitted by CGG
fall into three main categories: physical overrun by Not So Friendly troops,
Eavesdropping on the communications transmitted by CGG, and the personnel
actually using CGG.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. OverRun: A goodly portion of the CGG terminals are used by tactical ground
  forces in relatively forward areas. In addition, the field terminals are
  portable and thus even more susceptible to hostile actions. In the event
  that a live terminal were to be overrun (without opportunity to clear/destroy
  the equipment), the terminal would continue to send and receive, encrypt
  and decrypt, etc. until the network is informed, via other channels, of the
  overrun. This could lead to serious compromise of sensitive data and compromise
  the integrity of the CGG network through spurious messages sent from the
  captured CGG unit.
  <P>
  b. Eavesdrop: Being a communications system, the CGG is vulnerable to
  interception of transmissions. The communications are via radio leaving no
  physical signs of the interception having been made. Additionally, the far
  forward field terminals are vulnerable to discovery when transmitting.
  <P>
  c. Personnel: All personnel with authorized access to the CGG network have
  clearances and formal authorizations for all data on the net. [This simplifies
  the personnel aspects of the system because partial screening of portions
  of the data from portions of the personnel (like NDG and UG required) is
  not needed.]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
2. Data / Classified Material: All data on and in CGG is treated at the level
of the highest data allowed. The data falls into two main groups which are
discussed below.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Messages: Messages, both received and to be sent, are stored on the system
  as space allows. These messages must be protected at the highest level allowed
  on the system (even if they are just setting up dinner on Friday) because
  the system cannot differentiate between the (possibly) various levels of
  data within the system.
  <P>
  b. Stored Crypto Material: In order to facilitate orderly key change operations,
  the CGG stores keying material for the next change and further into the future
  as needed by operational requirements in the field. If this crypto material
  is not protected, the CGG network security is compromised for an extended
  time period (until all of the stored keying material has been replaced over
  the entire net, which could take a while with units in the field and net
  security compromised.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
3. Implementation:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Separate Encryption of Header and Message: In order to ensure that the
  messages only go to the intended recipients, the header and body of the messages
  are encrypted separately. The message header is decrypted (transparent to
  the operator) for all messages and only those messages which are intended
  for that particular terminal are made visible to the operator of the terminal.
  With both header and message encrypted and all messages going to each terminal,
  there is no unencrypted data available for analysis and analysis of the
  transmission patterns is limited.
  <P>
  b. Security at Net Control: Primary security is performed at the network
  level by the addition of a MicroVAX workstation dedicated to security. It
  is within this MicroVAX that auditing of events, journalling of messages,
  and Identification and Authentication occur. All actions which take place
  over the net are audited by Terminal, User, and event type. Each message
  which is sent
  <P>
  c. Security Down ? Net Down: In the event that the security work station
  becomes inoperable, the cabling can bypass the security processing and allow
  mission essential work to continue. During this time, the field terminals
  will still require their users to login, but the field terminal will accept
  the non-response from the (off-line) security workstation as a non-negative
  response and allow access even if passwords and such are incorrect. In addition,
  no event auditing or message journalling will take place until the workstation
  is back on line.
  <P>
  d. Security Operator ? Operator: Because the security is handled at the network
  level within an add-on MicroVAX workstation, the security personnel are separate
  from the user/operator personnel. While cleared at the same level as the
  users, the security personnel are given access to the MicroVAX and its
  functionality. The user password sets and the Security password sets are
  separate and if one person is both a user and a security operator that person
  will have two distinct IDs and passwords for the two distinct roles.
  <P>
  e. Clear Field Unit: The field unit has built-in clearing circuitry to clear
  all memory and all crypto keys. This can be operated either by the operator
  (in the event of imminent overrun or by the security operator at the MicroVAX
  (in the event of unannounced overrun, etc.). These clearing actions are
  non-destructive and will only require rekeying and reentry of operational
  data (like frequencies) to become operational again. For those circumstances
  where the changing of hands is more certain and there is sufficient lead
  time, provisions have been made for the physical destruction of the field
  terminal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
  <STRONG>D. GIGS: Ground Intelligence Gonculator System</STRONG>
</H3>
<P>
1. Threats: Because GIGS is a bunkered system, the threats from without are
greatly lessened by the physical security of the locale. The threats to GIGS
revolve around the personnel and functionality of the system itself. These
threat groupings are discussed in the paragraphs below.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Mixed Intel Types: While all users within GIGS are cleared to the same
  (high) level and all have formal access permissions for all of the data resident
  within the system, not all of the users have a verified Need-To-Know for
  all of the data. In particular, the two sets of intelligence analysts have
  little or no Need-To-Know for the data analyzed by the other set, with the
  exception of that data which is used synergistically to feed the collection
  schemes and build combined reports.
  <P>
  b. Bad Message Distribution: With the massive message processing capabilities
  of GIGS the possibility of mis-labelled, mis-routed, and mis-distributed
  messages looms large as a threat. With high volume message traffic, both
  incoming and outgoing, even a small probability flaw in the system can lead
  to substantial loss. With communications channels at varying classification
  levels there is an imperative need for the data to be well labelled so the
  computer can mediate the access to the communications port for each message
  sent.
  <P>
  c. Personnel: As with any situation involving people, a major threat source
  (of low probability) is the personnel. In the case of GIGS, with hundreds
  of personnel possessing high levels of access to the data, the risk is tangible.
  The personnel can be grouped as discussed below. (All personnel in both groupings
  are cleared to the level of and haves formal access permission to all of
  the data.)
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Two Sides of the Intelligence Community: The intelligence analysts on
    both sides of the house need to deal with the data itself. Both sides of
    the house guard their data closely from prying eyes outside their side of
    the house as well as the official Not So Friendly persons.
    <P>
    2) Comm and Maintenance: The communications and maintenance personnel do
    not need close access to the data itself but the nature of their duties lead
    to close contact with the data as it flows along their comm channels and
    needs to be diagnosed and tested during maintenance actions. In fact, the
    maintenance personnel have closer access than anyone because their actions
    naturally bypass the safeguards.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
2. Classified Data / Material: The sensitive (classified) material in GIGS
is at varying levels but the primary concern is the types of material. The
primary data categories are discussed below. Each category contains data
which may be at various levels of classification.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. Messages: Incoming and outgoing messages resident in GIGS are classified
  at various levels from Unclassified But Sensitive through Top Secret
  compartmentalized data. In addition, the incoming messages must be sorted
  and distributed based on classification and data set. The volume of incoming
  precludes hand sorting of the messages in a timely manner and the volume
  of the outgoing messages precludes a Man-In-The-Loop implementation.
  <P>
  b. Keying Material: With many network connectivities and dedicated lines,
  GIGS has numerous crypto devices of various types. These keys must be protected
  to ensure integrity of the communications channels and availability of the
  system to the Users.
  <P>
  c. Intel Databases: Massive databases are stored and updated by GIGS to support
  the analysts efforts. In addition, pertinent messages (both incoming and
  outgoing) are parsed, bent, folded, spindled, and mutilated to fit into the
  database as reference material. Bulk uploads from several agencies are fed
  to GIGS databases as available. These bulk uploads use various classification
  schemas and must be converted into GIGS format for classification and storage.
  The scale of the update effort is sufficient to require computer-driven
  reformatting and translation.
  <P>
  d. Security Data: The scope of the computer security functionality dictated
  massive data stores for the functionality. This data runs the gamut from
  Identification and Authentication (I&amp;A) data, to system security
  configuration files, to audit trails and message journals. This data must
  be protected not only from prying eyes within the system (and without) but
  must also be protected from unauthorized modification, particularly the audit
  and journal data. This data is classified at the level of the source of the
  data so pure Mandatory Access Controls (MAC) will not protect the data from
  within; for protection of the security data, the Discretionary Access Controls
  (DAC) must be the primary driver.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
3. Implementation: Th implementation of GIGS CompuSec is an integral part
of the GIGS system as a whole. The DAC, MAC, and audit capabilities handle
the primary burden with ancillary Information System Security Officer (ISSO)
functionality rounding out the package. Because the security functionality
primarily operates in a newly developed segment of GIGS, the implementation
was able to be built-in not added-on. MAC, DAC, and audit are discussed below.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  a. DAC: DAC is one of the least understood and defined areas in CompuSec.
  This lack of understanding and definition of the DAC arena gives more opportunity
  to adapt the security features to the conditions at hand. This also gives
  more opportunity for the DAC features to fail to meet the need. Care was
  taken with GIGS to ensure that the DAC functionality fit the situation and
  were sufficient.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Team Concept: Operationally, GIGS is manned by many people working in
    shifts of teams for a particular analysis type. The need for truly private
    data is essentially eliminated by the teaming and shift work. While there
    is still a need for personal data stores for preferences in setup and such,
    the data itself must be accessible to members of the team on all shifts.
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      a) User Groups: Access is granted by the DAC mechanisms based on the user
      group(s) in which the user has membership. The user groups determine access
      to sets of data, terminals, and peripherals. Each of the teams mentioned
      above is divided into one or more user groups for DAC purposes and individual
      users are granted membership to the appropriate user groups.
      <P>
      b) Personal Subdirectory: For personal data (work in progress, etc.) and
      personal preferences (screen layouts, open windows, standing queries, etc.)
      are stored in a personal subdirectory with a name based on the UserID which
      no one else has access to through ordinary channels.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    2) Menu Environment: GIGS has a menu-driven DECWindows implementation with
    no access to the bare system. This allows the system to only permit access
    to functionality by not offering the non-allowed functionality in the menus.
    GIGS operates based on function groups which are available to the user groups.
    On login for a user, the I&amp;A background data is checked for function
    group membership for that user, based on the user group memberships for the
    user, and builds menus which offer all of the user's allowed function access
    and no other functionality.
    <P>
    3) Bit Map Decision: The actual DAC decision mechanism is a simple ANDing
    of the bit pattern for a user's DAC user groups and the bit pattern of the
    object in question. If a non-zero answer results from the AND, access is
    granted because some user group in the user's DAC label matched a user group
    in the objects DAC label.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  b. MAC: MAC is well understood in and of itself. It is, after all, the security
  requirements which govern the classification and dissemination of paper data
  as well. The problems come with implementing the requirements in a computer.
  The classification levels themselves work well because they are strictly
  hierarchical (U&lt;C&lt;S&lt;TS). The compartments and code words, releasability,
  handling caveats, etc. add to the task of an orderly implementation because
  they are not always hierarchical. This leads to a lattice based view of MAC
  and partially ordered dominance being the basis of the MAC access decisions.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Analysis of Levels: For GIGS, the set of all meaningful components of
    the security lattice needed to be identified and the relations between the
    combined elements determined. While this sounds straight-forward, the relations
    (especially between groups in the intel community) were sometimes not
    well-defined. To simplify matters, the lattice was divided into sublattices
    of like markings. These sublattices were then well defined and melded into
    the complete lattice as the relations were completed.
    <P>
    2) Master Lattice List: The physical implementation of the lattice took the
    form of a series of arrays which contained the representations of the lattice
    elements suitable to the various needs. These representations include the
    bit patterns for each element (grouped by sublattice), the standard English
    version of the label in full and short forms and aliases for the standard
    version.
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      a) Bit Patterns: The combined lattice in bit form allows for simple access
      decisions because the patterns were allocated assign dominance a numeric
      superiority for the hierarchical portion and a simple subset check can handle
      the non-hierarchical portions.
      <P>
      Note: This was more than a simple bit setting though; for instance NATO
      Releasability is shown by turning bits off, not on because no releasability
      commentary (positive or negative) is the same as NOFORN.
      <P>
      b) Aliases: Aliases include the forms of the label which the system is allowed
      to accept in incoming messages (abbreviations, typical misspellings, etc.),
      and the ISSO defined form of the label to be used in various ways throughout
      the system (screen, window, icon, printed banner, message classification
      line, etc.). The standard English version of each lattice component is stored
      in long and short forms as FORTRAN Include files compiled into the code.
      The aliases are stored in tables readily alterable by the ISSO as needed.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
  c. Audit: The menu environment of GIGS makes auditing somewhat simpler than
  on a bare system. Because the actions available to the users are well defined
  and substantially limited, via the windowing process, the need to audit the
  lower level actions are reduced and the actions can be more clearly identified
  in the audit trail.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    1) Menu Selections and Errors: Essentially all of the audited actions are
    based on the menu selection made or errors/non-allowed access attempts. Each
    of these event types can be selected to be audited or not as the ISSO deems
    necessary with usability of the audit trail, operational demands, and available
    storage and processing power taken into account. The TCB has table-driven
    functionality for this auditing feature and the ISSO can readily modify the
    tables.
    <P>
    2) Message Journal: Each message sent from GIGS or received by GIGS is stored
    in its entirety in the message journal. (This is in addition to the parsed
    versions which may go to the database and the Read File version where users
    access to read their incoming mail or review outgoing mail.) The only user
    group with Read access to the journal is the ISSO Group. The only write access
    available to the ISSO is a message delete function (well audited) for the
    removal of messages classified outside the GIGS lattice inadvertently received
    by GIGS.
    <P>
    3) Size: The sheer magnitude of the operation of GIGS leads to sizing problems
    for the audit trail - approximately 24 gigabytes a month for 24 hour operation
    with all possible auditable events being audited. The message journal is
    over and above this figure. Off line storage is only a partial answer, because
    as the data set grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to access the needed
    data in the event of an incident. This leads to the ISSO auditing only those
    events which are most meaningful. This is made possible through ISSO tables,
    which allow each event type to be turned on and off at both the individual
    event level and as classes of events. The risk in doing business like this
    is that the incident may well make use of a not particularly security relevant
    function in a means not previously considered.
