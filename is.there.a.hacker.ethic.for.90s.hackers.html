                  Is there a Hacker Ethic for 90s Hackers?
                                      
   
  Introduction
  
   The goal of this text analysis project was to take the texts of the
   computer underground and to analyze them for the presence of a)
   knowledge about the Hacker Ethic and b) evolution of that Ethic. Many
   writers, such as Steven Levy, bemoan the fact that modern-day hackers
   (the computer underground) are not worthy of the name because they do
   not live up to the principles of the original Hacker Ethic, and as
   unethical individuals, should simply be called "computer terrorists"
   or "juvenile delinquents." I sought to examine whether 90s new hackers
   knew of the old Hacker Ethic, if they had added anything to it, and
   the reasons why they felt they acted differently from their
   predecessors. I broadened my text analysis to look at what they saw as
   ethical violations, and reasons why some might repudiate the Hacker
   Ethic or the idea of having an ethic.
   
   As my text project evolved, I found that after discovering the
   existence of a new hacker ethic for new hackers, I was wondering if
   people expressing the principles of the new ethic also expressed the
   old. I expected that the adoption of a new set of ethics would not
   necessarily mean the complete abandonment of the old. This would
   establish some continuity between both groups of hackers, and some
   familiarity by new hackers with the old ideals. If the hypothesis of
   continuity turns out to be true, then new hackers are not as different
   from old hackers as authors like Levy (or certain computer security
   professionals) might claim. They would then not only have their own
   ethics, but also utilize some ethical principles of their
   predecessors.
   
   I coded 29 documents from the computer underground online using the
   NUD*IST text analysis system. I allowed new codes to emerge from other
   codes, based on the sort of interactive text-searching and
   investigation process that NUDIST makes possible. I decided to code a
   few factors that were not directly relevant to my tests, but could
   provide avenues for future investigation. Finally, after coding, I
   came up with two tests to look at evidence for continuity between the
   old and new hacker ethics.
   
  Who is the Computer Underground?
  
   I define the computer underground as members of the following six
   groups. Sometimes I refer to the CU as "90s hackers" or "new hackers,"
   as opposed to old hackers, who are hackers (old sense of the term)
   from the 60s who subscribed to the original Hacker Ethic. See below.
   
    1. Hackers (Crackers, system intruders) - These are people who
       attempt to penetrate security systems on remote computers. This is
       the new sense of the term, whereas the old sense of the term
       simply referred to a person who was capable of creating hacks, or
       elegant, unusual, and unexpected uses of technology. Typical
       magazines (both print and online) read by hackers include 2600 and
       Iron Feather Journal.
    2. Phreaks (Phone Phreakers, Blue Boxers) - These are people who
       attempt to use technology to explore and/or control the telephone
       system. Originally, this involved the use of "blue boxes" or tone
       generators, but as the phone company began using digital instead
       of electro-mechanical switches, the phreaks became more like
       hackers. Typical magazines read by Phreaks include Phrack, Line
       Noize, and New Fone Express.
    3. Virus writers (also, creators of Trojans, worms, logic bombs) -
       These are people who write code which attempts to a) reproduce
       itself on other systems without authorization and b) often has a
       side effect, whether that be to display a message, play a prank,
       or trash a hard drive. Agents and spiders are essentially
       'benevolent' virii, raising the question of how underground this
       activity really is. Typical magazines read by Virus writers
       include 40HEX.
    4. Pirates - Piracy is sort of a non-technical matter. Originally, it
       involved breaking copy protection on software, and this activity
       was called "cracking." Nowadays, few software vendors use copy
       protection, but there are still various minor measures used to
       prevent the unauthorized duplication of software. Pirates devote
       themselves to thwarting these things and sharing commercial
       software freely with their friends. They usually read Pirate
       Newsletter and Pirate magazine.
    5. Cypherpunks (cryptoanarchists) - Cypherpunks freely distribute the
       tools and methods for making use of strong encryption, which is
       basically unbreakable except by massive supercomputers. Because
       the NSA and FBI cannot break strong encryption (which is the basis
       of the PGP or Pretty Good Privacy), programs that employ it are
       classified as munitions, and distribution of algorithms that make
       use of it is a felony. Some cryptoanarchists advocate strong
       encryption as a tool to completely evade the State, by preventing
       any access whatsoever to financial or personal information. They
       typically read the Cypherpunks mailing list.
    6. Anarchists - are committed to distributing illegal (or at least
       morally suspect) information, including but not limited to data on
       bombmaking, lockpicking, pornography, drug manufacturing, pirate
       radio, and cable and satellite TV piracy. In this parlance of the
       computer underground, anarchists are less likely to advocate the
       overthrow of government than the simple refusal to obey
       restrictions on distributing information. They tend to read Cult
       of the Dead Cow (CDC) and Activist Times Incorporated (ATI).
    7. Cyberpunk - usually some combination of the above, plus interest
       in technological self-modification, science fiction of the
       Neuromancer genre, and interest in hardware hacking and "street
       tech." A youth subculture in its own right, with some overlaps
       with the "modern primitive" and "raver" subcultures.

  The Original Hacker Ethic
  
   Every profession or trade tends to have an ethical code which suggests
   that it is capable of self-regulation of its members. The code
   demonstrates the shared core values necessary for people to practice
   within the professional community. And it enables the public and the
   government to have some degree of trust for the profession. Some of
   these codes may be very ancient and formalized, such as the
   Hippocratic Oath sworn by physicians. Others may be very modern and
   legalistic, like the code of ethics for applied or academic
   anthropologists. Some ethical systems may be "underground," (such as
   the Pirates' Code of 18th century buccaneers or Mafia oaths of
   loyalty) enabling members of subcultures or groups to survive,
   cooperate, and escape outsiders. Yet others like the original Hacker
   Ethic are very informal and simple - rules of thumb to live by.
   
   Groups employ different means of enforcing their ethical systems. Some
   provisions are often recognized as simply being archaic and are
   ignored. This is why most doctors do not heed the prohibitions in the
   Hippocratic Oath against abortion or euthanasia, yet most (but not
   all!) believe in the ethical principle of not refusing critical
   treatment to a patient who is unable to pay. Other groups (such as
   anthropologists) often devise ethical codes simply because they are
   forced to by the bad behavior of some of their members in the past,
   and their provisions are specifically tailored to probems that have
   arisen. Violating some ethical codes can get you banned from the
   profession or worse, when professional associations exist to enforce
   the regulations; with hackers, breaking the Hacker Ethic seems to
   result mostly in anathema or social ostracization, a time-honored
   method of social control.
   
   The original Hacker Ethic was sort of an impromptu, informal ethical
   code developed by the original hackers of MIT and Stanford (SAIL) in
   the 50s and 60s. These "hackers" were the first generation of
   programmers, employing time-sharing terminal access to 'dumb'
   mainframes, and they often confronted various sorts of bureaucratic
   interference that prevented them from exploring fully how
   technological systems (computers, but also model trains, university
   steam tunnels, university phone systems, etc.) worked. The ethic
   reflects their resistance to these obstacles, and their ideology of
   the liberatory power of technology. The six principles of the Hacker
   Ethic are listed below, with some text samples showing where it
   appears within these documents.
   
   A concise summation of it can be found in Steven Levy's 1984 book
   Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution. Levy suggested that
   because of their Ethic and their unconventional style, hackers like
   Jobs and Wozniak were able to launch the "computer revolution,"
   resulting in the first personal computer (the Apple) which was easy to
   use and which put programming power in the individual's hands. Here I
   cite documents from my sample which reiterate some of its principles.
   
    1. Hands On Imperative: Access to computers and hardware should be
       complete and total. It is asserted to be a categorical imperative
       to remove any barriers between people and the use and
       understanding of any technology, no matter how large, complex,
       dangerous, labyrinthine, proprietary, or powerful.
       
     As we can see, this has not been the case. The computer system has
     been solely in the hands of big businesses and the government. The
     wonderful device meant to enrich life has become a weapon which
     dehumanizes people. To the government and large businesses, people
     are no more than disk space, and the government doesn't use
     computers to arrange aid for the poor, but to control nuclear death
     weapons. The average American can only have access to a small
     microcomputer which is worth only a fraction of what they pay for
     it. The businesses keep the true state of the art equipment away
     from the people behind a steel wall of incredibly high prices and
     bureaucracy. It is because of this state of affairs that hacking
     was born. ("Doctor Crash", 1986)[1]
    2. "Information Wants to Be Free" "Information wants to be free" can
       be interpreted in three ways. Free might mean without restrictions
       (freedom of movement = no censorship), without control (freedom of
       change/evolution = no ownership or authorship, no intellectual
       property), or without monetary value (no cost.) Some hackers even
       take this to mean information is alive, free to act on its own
       agency, as viruses, genetic algorithms, 'bots and other software
       programs do. Most hackers seem to advocate this principle in
       different senses of the word "free" at different times. In any
       case, when asked about the content of the Hacker Ethic, most
       people assert this as the key principle.
       
     There is much knowledge that is disallowed, hidden. Government
     activities, corporate crime, and "illegitimate" information needs
     to be disseminated. People without access to technology need it -
     they can contribute to the world. Distributing this information is
     illegal, potentially dangerous. This, in my humble opinion, is the
     best use of hacked accounts. Obtaining information, disseminating
     information needs anonymity. This protects your hide. This is
     important. Whistle blowers are only silenced when their identity is
     known...
         _____________________________________________________________
                                        
                           Access to information
       
     Yes, access is a right you have. You need to know when the
     government is killing people, radiating them, listening to them,
     lying to them, lying to you. You have a right to gain access to
     information about OUR government. This government is supposedly of
     the people, by the people, power granted by a social contract.[2]
    3. Mistrust Authority. Promote decentralization. This element of the
       ethic shows its strong anarchistic, individualistic, and
       libertarian nature. Hackers have always shown distrust toward
       large institutions, including but not limited to the State,
       corporations, and computer administrative bureaucracies (the IBM
       'priesthood'). Tools like the PC are said to move power away from
       large organizations (who use mainframes) and put them in the hands
       of the 'little guy' user. Nowhere is this ethos stronger than
       among the anti-statist cypherpunks and extropians.
       
     In fact, technology represents one of the most promising avenues
     available for re-capturing our freedoms from those who have stolen
     them. By its very nature, it favors the bright (who can put it to
     use) over the dull (who cannot). It favors the adaptable (who are
     quick to see the merit of the new (over the sluggish, who cling to
     time-tested ways). And what two better words are there to describe
     government bureaucracy than "dull" and "sluggish"?[3]
         _____________________________________________________________
                                        
     The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this
     technology, citing national security concerns, use of the
     technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal
     disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto
     anarchy will allow national secrets to be traded freely and will
     allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous
     computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for
     assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements
     will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the
     spread of cryptoanarchy.[4]
    4. No Bogus Criteria: Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not
       by "bogus criteria" such as race, age, sex, or position. Nowhere
       is this ethos more apparent than in the strong embrace by most
       hackers of the levelling power of the Internet, where anonymity
       makes it possible for all such 'variables' about a person to
       remain unknown, and where their ideas must be judged on their
       merits alone since such contextual factors are not available.
       
     The Internet is one of the best hacks the world has to offer. It
     has continually shattered deeply ingrained social prejudices
     concerning characteristics such as age, race, wealth, and sex. In
     fact, it is common to find 14 year olds arguing philosophy with 41
     year olds on America's computer networks![5]
    5. "You can create truth and beauty on a computer." Hacking is
       equated with artistry and creativity. Furthermore, this element of
       the ethos raises it to the level of philosophy (as opposed to
       simple pragmatism), which (at least in some quarters) is about
       humanity's search for the good, the true, and the beautiful.
       
     Without question, good/great programming (hacking) is art and as
     with art each person has their own signature and style (which
     changes over time). Quite a few years ago I was reviewing some
     derivative works of one hacker, and found the lack of signature and
     style of the original.[6]
    6. "Computers can change your life for the better." In some ways,
       this last statement really is simply a corollary of the previous
       one. Since most of humanity desires things that are good, true,
       and/or beautiful, the fact that a computer can create such things
       would seem to mean that axiomatically it can change peoples' lives
       for the better. However, this is merely a declarative statement,
       which like the previous one reflects a deep-felt love of
       technology. It does not state explicitly that computers should
       always change peoples' lives for the better, or the principle that
       would follow from that, which is that it is unethical to use them
       to make peoples' lives worse. .. Many hackers see the Internet as
       an immense positive force, and this reiterated again by hacker
       Emmanuel Goldstein --
       
     The future holds such enormous potential. It is vital that we not
     succumb to our fears and allow our democratic ideals and privacy
     values to be shattered. In many ways, the world of cyberspace is
     more real than the real world itself. I say this because it is only
     within the virtual world that people are really free to be
     themselves - to speak without fear of reprisal, to be anonymous if
     they so choose, to participate in a dialogue where one is judged by
     the merits of their words, not the color of their skin or the
     timbre of their voice. Contrast this to our existing "real" world
     where we often have people sized up before they even utter a word.
     The Internet has evolved, on its own volition, to become a true
     bastion of worldwide democracy. It is the obligation of this
     committee, and of governments throughout the world, not to stand in
     its way.[7]
       
   Thus, the ethical principles of the Hacker Ethic suggest it is the
   ethical duty of the hacker to remove barriers, liberate information,
   decentralize power, honor people based on their ability, and create
   things that are good and life-enhancing through computers. It remains
   an open question (of interpretation) as to whether it advocates the
   free distribution of software (the GNU/Richard Stallman position), the
   injunction against using computers for malicious purposes (the
   Clifford Stoll position), or the need for secure networks based on
   trust (the Steven Levy position.) Each of these document samples show
   that new hackers are aware of, and advocate (whether intentionally or
   accidentally) elements of the original Hacker Ethic.
   
  New Hacker Ethic
  
   From my documents, I found that there is a new hacker ethic which 90s
   hackers live by. There are fragments of continuity from the old hacker
   ethic, as one can see. The new ethic appears to have developed like
   the old one, informally and by processes of mutual reinforcement. The
   new ethic seems to contain some ambiguities (like the old one) and a
   few contradictions. This may be due to the fact that its practicioners
   are more numerous and more dispersed than the original 60s hackers.
   
    1. "Above all else, do no harm" Do not damage computers or data if at
       all possible. Much like the key element of the Hippocratic Oath.
       
     According to the "hacker ethic," a hack must: * be safe
     * not damage anything
     * not damage anyone, either physically, mentally or emotionally
     * be funny, at least to most of the people who experience it
       [8]
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
     It is against hacker ethics to alter any data aside from the logs
     that are needed to clean their tracks. They have no need or desire
     to destroy data as the malicious crackers. They are there to
     explore the system and learn more. The hacker has a constant
     yearning and thirst for knowledge that increases in intensity as
     their journey progresses.[9]
     
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
     2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is
     ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or
     breach of confidentiality.[10]
     
   Of course, the key problem with this ethical position is its stance on
   intent. One should not damage data deliberately. But what if, as often
   happens in hacking attempts, one accidentally erases or alters data
   while trying to alter system log files or user records? Is that an
   ethical violation? Also, the question of what constitutes "harm" is
   left open. Most hackers seem to see pranks and practical jokes as
   harmless, regardless of their psychological impact. Yet their victims
   may not feel these are so 'harmless,' especially if this causes them
   to lose valuable time or effort.
   
     Protect Privacy People have a right to privacy, which means control
   over their own personal (or even familial) information. Privacy rights
   are notably missing from the U.S. Constitution, but they have been
   brought to the forefront of modern legal argument due to the growing
   surveillance power of technology. There still is no codified right to
   privacy for U.S. citizens, although the Supreme Court has ruled that
   it is contained implicitly in its judgements legalizing the
   distribution of birth control and the right to first-trimester
   abortion.
   
   How far do privacy rights go, however? Do people also have an
   intrinsic right to online anonymity? Do I have the right to conceal my
   health status, criminal record, or sexuality from my employer? Are
   some people (politicians, celebrities, etc.) entitled to less privacy
   than others? Does my social security number, credit history, or
   telephone number belong only to me? Further, the strange thing about
   hackers asserting a right to privacy is that it declares a certain
   kind of information to not be free. Thus, in some ways this is a
   contradiction to the original hacker ethic.
   
                           Your right to Privacy
                                      
     Privacy is a right we beleive we have. Unfortunately privacy is not
     explicitately protected in the constitution. Our consitution is
     dated in that respect, there weren't the threats to privacy then as
     there are now. Technology is truly a double-edged sword. The
     abscense of privacy provisions in the constitution does not make it
     any less important. Indeed, the lack of constitutional protections
     have allowed our privacy to be gravely threatened.[11]
     
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
     The concept of privacy is something that is very important to a
     hacker. This is so because hackers know how fragile privacy is in
     today's world. Wherever possible we encourage people to protect
     their directories, encrypt their electronic mail, not use cellular
     phones, and whatever else it takes to keep their lives to
     themselves. In 1984 hackers were instrumental in showing the world
     how TRW kept credit files on millions of Americans. Most people had
     never even heard of a credit file until this happened. Passwords
     were very poorly guarded - in fact, credit reports had the password
     printed on the credit report itself.[12]
     
   The second argument is an interesting one. The problem most hackers
   had with TRW is not they kept files on most peoples' credit histories
   without their knowledge (thus they couldn't see if they contained any
   errors), and it was on that (unknown) basis that they were denied
   loans, credit cards, mortgages, etc. It was that those files were
   insecure.
   
     "Waste not, want not." Computer resources should not lie idle and
   wasted. It's ethically wrong to keep people out of systems when they
   could be using them during idle time. This is what some people call
   the "joy riders' ethic." If you borrow someone's car, and return it
   with no damage, a full tank of gas, and perhaps even some suggestions
   for improved performance, have you not done them a favor? Especially
   if they never know you borrowed it in the first place for a few road
   trips? Isn't it wasting that precious engine power to leave the car in
   a parking spot while somebody else could be using it for a grocery
   trip? (Is it an ethical violation to borrow the car and make a set of
   keys for yourself so you can borrow it whenever you feel like? This
   is, after all, what most hackers do when they give themselves sysadmin
   privileges.) Yet most are possessive over the use of their own
   personal computer.
   
     The hacker ethics involves several things. One of these is avoiding
     waste. Over the internet, we have about a quarter million computers
     each of which is virtually unused for 10 hours a day. A true hacker
     seeing something useful that he could do with terraflops of
     computing power that would otherwise be wasted might would request
     permission to use these machines and would probably go ahead and
     use them even if permission was denied. In doing so, he would take
     the greatest possible precautions to not damage the system.[13]
     
     Exceed Limitations Hacking is about the continual transcendence of
   problem limitations. Some old hackers assert this principle, as an
   informal seventh addition to the original Ethic. Telling a hacker
   something can't be done, is a moral imperative for him to try.
   "Extropians" believe there is a universal force of expansion and
   growth, inverse to entropy, which they call "extropy." Hacking is seen
   as extropian because it always seeks to surpass current limits.
   Technology is seen as a necessarily exponential force of growth.
   Limitations must be overcome. For some hackers, these limitations
   might be unjust laws or outdated moral codes.
   
     To become free it may be necessary to break free from medieval
     morality, break unjust laws, and be a disloyal employee. Some may
     call you an disloyal, sinful criminal. To be free in a room of
     slaves is demoralizing. Free your fellow man, give him the tools,
     the knowledge to fight oppression. Do not infringe on others'
     rights.[14]
     
     The Communicational Imperative People have the right to communicate
   and associate with their peers freely. The United Nations
   International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has stated in many
   conferences that this should be a fundamental human right, with which
   no nation should ever interfere. The sweeping freedoms given to
   amateur radio hobbyists internationally reflect this belief. Globally,
   it remains a significant moral problem, in that most developing
   nations lack the infrastructure to grant this right. Various UN
   reports have shown that despite the rhetoric, many Third World nations
   do not have access to the "global" information superhighway because
   they lack "onramps." Their telecommunications infrastructure is
   lacking.
   
   Most hackers strongly support the 1st amendments' rights to
   communication and assembly, since these are necessary for the free
   flow of information. Phreakers take this a step beyond, however, in
   asserting that people should have the right to communicate with each
   other cheaply (thus poor people have as much right to talk on the
   phone long distance as the rest of us) and easily . When
   telecommunications companies are an obstacle to this right to
   communicate, phreaking (blue boxing the phone system, making
   unauthorized 'bridge' conference calls, using empty voicemail boxes,
   etc.) is said to be the answer.
   
                          The Right to communicate
                                      
     Communicate!
     This is our strongest right, and our most crucial. There mere fact
     that this page is allowed to exist is proof that our 1st amendment
     has not crumbled completely. Despite the governmental protection,
     there are threats to our freedom to communicate.[15]
     
     Leave No Traces Don't leave a trail or trace of your presence; don't
   call attention to yourself or your exploits. Keep quiet, so everyone
   can enjoy what you have. This is an ethical principle, in that the
   hacker follows it not only for his own self-interest, but also to
   protect other hackers from being caught or losing access. Such a
   principle can be found among various criminal or underground
   organizations. Of course, there is a contradiction between asserting a
   need for secrecy (as well as privacy), and the need for unrestricted
   information.
   
     The rules a Hacker lives by:
     1. Keep a low profile.
     2. If suspected, keep a lower profile.
     3. If accused, deny it.
     4. If caught, plea the 5th.[16]
     
     Share! Information increases in value by sharing it with the maximum
   number of people; don't hoard, don't hide. Just because it wants to be
   free, does not mean necessarily you must give it to as many people as
   possible. This principle can be seen as an elaboration on an original
   ethical principle. The Pirates' ethic is that piracy increases
   interest in software, by giving people a chance to try it out and
   experiment with it before paying for it. So sharing software with your
   friends is a good thing.
   
     Pirates SHARE warez to learn, trade information, and have fun! But,
     being a pirate is more than swapping warez. It's a life style and a
     passion. The office worker or class mate who brings in a disk with
     a few files is not necessarily a pirate any more than a friend
     laying a copy of the lastest Depeche Mode album on you is a pirate.
     The *TRUE* pirate is plugged into a larger group of people who
     share similar interests in warez. This is usually done through
     Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs), and the rule of thumb is "you gotta
     give a little to get a little...ya gets back what ya gives."
     Pirates are NOT freeloaders, and only lamerz think they get
     something for nothing.[17]
     
     Self Defense against a Cyberpunk Future Hacking and viruses are
   necessary to protect people from a possible 1984/cyberpunk dystopian
   future, or even in the present from the growing power of government
   and corporations. It's a moral imperative to use hacking as the
   equivalent of 'jujitsu,' allowing the individual to overcome larger,
   more impersonal, more powerful forces that can control their lives. If
   governments and corporations know they can be hacked, then they will
   not overstep their power to afflict the citizenry.
   
     I believe, before it's all over, that the War between those who
     love liberty and the control freaks who have been waiting for to
     rid America of all that constitutional mollycoddling called the
     Bill of Rights, will escalate.
     
     Should that come to pass, I will want to use every available method
     to vex and confuse the eyes and ears of surveillance. Viruses could
     become the necessary defense against a government that fears your
     computer.[18]
     
   What's interesting is that this principle recognizes and asserts that
   it's not only possible but also likely for computers to have a dark
   side and to be used for purposes other than truth and beauty, and that
   we need to be wary of technology, or at least technology in the wrong
   hands.
   
     Hacking Helps Security This could be called the "Tiger team ethic":
   it is useful and courteous to find security holes, and then tell
   people how to fix them. Hacking is a positive force, because it shows
   people how to mend weak security, or in some cases to recognize and
   accept that total security is unattainable, without drastic sacrifice.
   
     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of
     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering. But
     the belief that `ethical' cracking excludes destruction at least
     moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as `benign'
     crackers (see also samurai). Based on this view, it may be one of
     the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to (a) break into a system,
     and then (b) explain to the sysop, preferably by email from a
     superuser account, exactly how it was done and how the hole can be
     plugged --- acting as an unpaid (and unsolicited) tiger team.[19]
     
   Many software companies today, including Lotus, regularly use tiger
   teams to test their security systems. So, this ethical principle seems
   to be agreed upon by some members of the industry -- to a certain
   extent. Even Lotus does not want its systems being tested by hackers
   who are not under its employ or control.
   
     Trust, but Test! You must constantly test the integrity of systems
   and find ways to improve them. Do not leave their maintenance and
   schematics to others; understand fully the systems you use or which
   affect you. If you can exploit certain systems (such as the telephone
   network) in ways that their creators never intended or anticipated,
   that's all to the better. This could help them create better systems.
   One of those systems that may require constant revision, testing, and
   adjustment, apparently, is constitutional democracy.
   
     Democracy is always being tested -- it's an inherent part of what
     it stands for. whether it's flag burners, gay activists, klansmen,
     or computer hackers, we're always testing the system to see if it
     holds up to pressure. i stress that this is NOT an end iwe do
     because it interests us, but in the bigger picture we're actually
     testing the sincerity of the democratic system, whether we're aware
     of it or not.[20]
     
   One of the most important manuals for British hackers was called
   "beating the system." The essential argument is that as systems (like
   the phone network) become more and more complex, they become
   impossible to manage from a centralized office. Hacking at the edges
   of the system not only becomes possible, in some cases it becomes
   necessary. It becomes an ethical imperative to test the system, lest
   it fail when it is most needed (like the AT & T phone switches did in
   1990.)
   
   So, in short, the new hacker ethic suggests that it is the ethical
   duty of new hackers (or the CU), to : 1) protect data and hardware 2)
   respect and protect privacy 3) utilize what is being wasted by others
   4) exceed unnecessary restrictions 5) promote peoples' right to
   communicate 6) leave no traces 7) share data and software 8) be
   vigilant against cyber-tyranny and 9) test security and system
   integrity of computer systems.
   
  Violations/Transgressions
  
   These could be considered the "thou shalt nots" of the new hacker
   ethic, as opposed to its affirmative "you shoulds." Some of these
   transgressions of the hacker ethic are already implied by some of its
   basic affirmative principles. We can get an idea of what hackers
   believe they should do, based on what they reject as unsuitable
   activities of their peers.
   
    1. Bootlegging Commercialism; selling pirated software; hacking for
       profit; selling out. Bootlegging violates the new ethic of sharing
       and the original hacker ethic which eschewed profit (and embraced
       personal satisfaction) as a reason for creating software (hence
       the existence of Richard Stallman's GNU Free Software Foundation.)
       
     On occasion the possibility of making a profit from these advances
     tempts hackers into commercialism. On other occasions, they see
     commercialism as the only way to get their work into the hands of
     the masses. When they succeed they become rich, and usually get
     moved further and further from hacker life and more and more into
     paperwork and then don't live happily ever after.[21]
         _____________________________________________________________
                                        
     Bootleggers are to pirates as a chop-shop is to a home auto
     mechanic. Bootleggers are people who DEAL stolen merchandise for
     personal gain. Bootleggers are crooks. They sell stolen goods.
     Pirates are not crooks, and most pirates consider bootleggers to be
     lower life forms than child molesters.[22]
       Bootlegging seems to contradict new hacker ethic 7, share!
    2. Freeloading Always taking and never contributing. Profitting from
       other peoples' efforts without adding to them. "Warez d00dz" and
       "Codez d00dz" who are hunting for free software or phone codes
       without offering anything in return (a hack, a number, whatever)
       are looked down upon. Hoarding and refusing to tell others about
       your hacks are seen as wrong. This also violates the new ethic of
       sharing.
       
     In fact, pirates may be one of the best forms of advertising for
     quality products, because sharing allows a shop-around method for
     buying warez. Most of us buy a program for the documents and the
     support, but why invest in four or five similar programs if we
     aren't sure which best suits our needs? Nah, pirates aren't
     freeloaders. We are against freeloading.[23]
    3. Trashing Crashing systems; destroying hardware; hurting other
       users; malicious vandalism; irreversible damaging or destroying of
       data; unleashing destructive viruses, Trojans, logic bombs.
       Prankful (non-harmless) games with users and sysops and systems is
       acceptable... This is seen as the obvious corollary of the new
       ethic to "do no harm."
       
     I. Do not intentionally damage *any* system. Trashing BBSes is
     wrong, plain and simple.
     II. Do not alter any system files other than ones needed to ensure
     your escape from detection and your future access (Trojan Horses,
     Altering Logs, and the like are all necessary to your survival for
     as long as possible.)[24]
         _____________________________________________________________
                                        
     The one thing I hate, is the way some self-appointed hackers find
     there way into a system, and ruin the name of the rest of us by
     destroying everything they can find. Now that is pathetic. First of
     all, as I said, it ruins the name of the rest of us. Thus, once
     again, the "Destructive Computer User" Stereotype... A board
     crasher is no more a "hacker" than my grandmother is.[25]
    4. Excessive Selfishness Self interest overrules any concern for
       other hackers whatsoever. This violation implies others... once
       again, we run into the strange divide at the heart of the Hacker
       Ethic, which is deeply individualistic, yet also fiercely
       communal. Individuals are expected to be highly self-motivated,
       but not selfish.
       
     I think you'd be less agitated if you define your categories as
     hackers and criminals. The former are in it to explore and the
     latter are in it for themselves and nothing else. Of course, some
     hackers do break laws on occasion but I don't think that
     necessarily turns them into criminals, at least not in the moral
     sense.[26] 
         _____________________________________________________________
                                        
     Also, some hackers have this massive ego problem... I must name one
     here, for that problem, and he is Corporal Punishment... I have had
     numerous run-ins with this guy. He seems to think he is a God,
     constantly running everyone into the ground. He even went as far as
     saying "PHRACK sucks!" But he isn't the only one with that
     problem... Some feel that if they put others down, they will
     elevate to a higher level. Sorry to burst you bubble guys, but your
     only viewed as massive ego-maniacs that deserve nothing less than
     being run down yourselves...[27]
         _____________________________________________________________
                                        
     Let us not forget that hackers, crackers, chippers, crunchers, and
     whatnot all have ego, and one thing that bothers me about using the
     Hacker Ethic to describe people is that ego and self-interest are
     not accounted for. How else can you explain crackers selling
     pirated software, otherwise intelligent people distributing viruses
     to the general public in hope of causing maximum damage to other
     users, or hackers breaking into some system and erasing files for
     laughs? People break into computers because it's fun and it makes
     one feel powerful, not because there is untapped power waiting to
     be used if only the right programming "wizard" comes along.[28]
    5. The (Selective) Anti-Stealing Ethic Information, services, and
       software are not property; hardware, physical property, money, and
       monetary services (credit cards, digital cash, phone card numbers)
       are. Theft of these is still wrong. Also, the target makes a
       difference. Stealing phone service (say, voicemail boxes) from a
       large institution like a corporation or the government is OK.
       Stealing it from an individual or a small nonprofit is not.
       Thus the new hacker ethic, according to its propagandists, does
       not embrace theft; instead it simply defines certain things (like
       information) as not being personal property, or certain actions
       (using phone service) as "borrowing" rather than theft.
       
     So where is the boundary between the hacker world and the criminal
     world? To me, it has always been in the same place. We know that
     it's wrong to steal tangible objects. We know that it's wrong to
     vandalize. We know that it's wrong to invade somebody's privacy.
     Not one of these elements is part of the hacker world.[29]
    6. Bragging Calling too much attention to oneself. It is acceptable
       ('elite') to brag in private hacker circles, unacceptable to brag
       or make taunts and dares to sysops, law enforcement, or
       authorities, or in any public forum where they tend to listen.
       Some hackers even consider the first unacceptable, since hacker
       boards are monitored by the Secret Service as well. Bragging and
       boasting to the media or other non-hackers violates the ethic of
       'leave no trace' and keeping a low profile.
       
     Bragging after a neat hack may seem like the natural thing to do.
     But just remember that it can only call attention to yourself, and
     not everyone who pays attention to hackers are admirers. You may
     jeopardize your friends and anyone else who ever accesses the same
     system as you.[30]
         _____________________________________________________________
                                        
     True hackers are quiet. I don't mean they talk at about .5 dB, I
     mean they keep their mouths shut and don't brag. The number one
     killer of those the media would have us call hackers is bragging.
     You tell a friend, or you run your mouth on a board, and sooner or
     later people in power will find out what you did, who you are, and
     you're gone...[31]
    7. Spying Snooping, monitoring of people, and invading their privacy
       is wrong... so therefore is reading private e-mail, etc. This
       follows from the new hacker ethic which sees privacy as a
       fundamental right. However, part of the hacker praxis is about
       finding out passwords and security holes from users, whether
       through "social engineering" or simple snooping and "sniffing."
       This is the contradiction, once again, of embracing privacy but
       also insisting on unrestricted information.
       
     Some crackers are using computers in the exact *opposite* way that
     the first hackers intended them: first, by restricting the
     unimpeded and unmonitored flow of information through the computer
     networks and phone lines; and second, by using computers to monitor
     people, by intrusive methods of information-gathering.[32]
    8. Narcing It is wrong to turn other hackers in. This part of their
       ethical code is not different from many other criminal
       organizations or subcultures, such as prison inmates, drug
       addicts, prostitutes, etc., or even 'above-ground' subcultures
       such as police departments. ("code of silence.") However, this
       code has special meaning for hackers, since many ex-hackers often
       decide to become computer security personnel later in life. Many
       of their peers consider this 'selling out.'
       
     There's no lower form of life than the narc. Hackers who go and rat
     on other hackers are scum. They get lots of promises of immunity
     and stuff if they turn in all their friends. Some hackers get back
     at other people by turning them into the feds. This is wrong, and
     it only damages the hacker community. We need to stick together,
     because nobody else is really on our side.[33]
         _____________________________________________________________
                                        
     The last thing I will mention, will be hackers turning in other
     hackers to federal crime agencies, or to the PhoneCorp security
     offices, or any other type of company that deals with computer
     related phraud. This activity, refered to as Narcing, is getting to
     be too popular for a hackers good... You may be saying, " Come on,
     no hacker in they're right mind would turn another on in ". And
     your right... It's once again those self proclaimed hackers, or the
     ones who think they are who will do this to get "Even"...[34]
       
   We can then see that new hackers do believe certain things are wrong -
   and people who commit these actions are frowned upon and often
   prevented from being recognized by the hacker community. Many of the
   things new hackers reject, would also be rejected by the community of
   old hackers.
   
  Reasons for Change
  
   I coded various "emic" explanations in these texts for why some people
   felt the Hacker Ethic had changed. These could potentially provide the
   basis for looking for some interesting etic, measurable variables.
   
    1. "More Stuff" Computers are more numerous, more powerful, more
       networked, more distributed, more important, more widespread. More
       power over society = more corruption, more incentive.
       
     So the process of society adopting a new technology BY DEFINITION
     must include the removal of all idealistic motivations originally
     present in the promoters of the technology. Computers are power,
     and direct contact with power can bring out the best or the worst
     in a person. The Hacker Ethic is simply the ideal case: it's
     tempting to think that everyone exposed to the technology will be
     so grandly inspired, but alas, it just ain't so.
     
     The "hacker ethic" was unnoticed before because fiddling with large
     complex systems was so difficult until recently. There have always
     been basement tinkers and young pranksters but their explorations
     were very local. Once we are all connected, the work of these
     investigators ripple through the world we have constructed and
     affect us.[35]
         _____________________________________________________________
                                        
     We live in the age of computers. Everything is controlled by
     massive mainframes; Our water distribution system, rail-road
     control, airline control, electricity control, telephone companies,
     etc, etc, etc... Imagine the fun someone can have in one of those
     systems!!! Just the fact of getting in them can sometimes be a
     major accomplishment. But my point is, what people do once they are
     in...[36]
    2. Society Society has changed for the worse. Either the old hackers
       lived in a more sheltered, supportive, rewarding environment (the
       MIT lab where they had access to everything they could ever want,
       plus recognition from their mentors and peers), or they simply
       lived in a larger society (the U.S. of the 50s) which was more
       based on trust, honesty, etc., and that is why their behavior was
       different. This might be the sort of sociological explanation
       found in a sociology textbook.
       
     PANTY RAIDS: When panty raids meet biotech it may be time to adapt
     new rituals; or the cracker phenomena is more complex then that and
     has at least something to do with increased levels of social
     alienation and how the street finds its own use for things.[37]
         _____________________________________________________________
                                        
     It is my contention that hackers did not change. Society changed,
     and it changed for the worse. The environment the early hackers
     were working in rewarded them for their mischief and their desire
     to experiment and try new things.[38]
    3. The Computer Industry has Sold Out
       The computer industry sold out; no commercial software developers
       today believe in the Hacker Ethic either. They patent software,
       copy-protect programs, lock up data and algorithms. New hackers
       are merely responding to the times. They wouldn't have to do what
       they have to do if the computer industry believed in open
       standards and systems and free source code.
       
     And yet, in practice, I can't help but conclude that the computer
     revolution is over, and that the people lost. The computer
     community is driven now not by a lust for knowledge but by a lust
     for money. What were fledgling companies of wild-eyed programmers
     sharing knowledge and feeding on each other's ideas have become
     corporate behemoths, run by suits and ties, and copyright lawyers,
     and the bottom line.[39]
    4. Generational Change Hackers, like other youth of their generation
       ("generation X"), are more alienated, more pessimistic, more
       self-centered, more thoughtless, more careless, more pragmatic,
       etc. It's not that society, technology, or computing practices
       changed; it's just that new hackers come from a generation which
       was raised differently from its predecessors and was exposed to
       different influences.
       
     It's like you sometimes see in the media - 'GenX' is more in it for
     themselves, more likely to try and get ahead through using
     information from any which way, and more often see themselves as
     getting screwed over by their elders ... so it's not surprising
     that they don't have the same attitudes as Baby Boomer hackers.[40]
       
   A future research project might be to try and turn these into etic
   variables. If one could operationalize and measure "level of
   alienation" for the authors of these texts, it might turn out to be a
   causal factor for "level of adherence to the Hacker Ethic," which
   would be the degree to which the person espouses the old or new Hacker
   ethics. Or one could try and correlate changes in the Hacker Ethic
   with changes in computing practices or level of intensification of
   computer use.
   
  Repudiations
  
   It's interesting to examine the ways in which 90s hackers often
   repudiate the original Hacker Ethic, or the possibility of embracing
   any Ethic at all. These are based on some items I coded in the texts,
   and other mentions found on the Net.
   
    1. Fraud "The hacker ethic is a fraud" perpetrated by the original
       hackers. It's too idealistic to possibly work in the real world.
       
     But the Hacker Ethic is also a fraud. It is a fraud because there
     is nothing magical about computers that causes one of its users or
     owners to undergo religious conversions and devote themselves to
     use of the computer for the betterment of the public good. Early
     automobile enthusiasts were tinkerers, inventors, people with a
     dream building motorized transportation. Then the new invention
     became popular and the elite used it to drive around in luxury.
     Then the new invention became accessible, and for many, necessary
     for survival. Now we have traffic jams, drunk drivers, air
     pollution, and suburban sprawl. Whatever magic still present in the
     use of the automobile occasionally surfaces, but we possess no
     delusions that it automatically invades the consciousness of
     everyone who sits behind the wheel.[41]
    2. Individualism Individualistic loners don't tend to subcribe to
       communal ethics. Many hackers argue that hacking is by nature
       oriented toward individualism rather than "groupthink," and thus
       the community of hackers is one of mutually reinforcing
       self-interest rather than any true form of fellowship or common
       ideology.
    3. Many, not one There is no one single hacker ethic; in the extreme
       position, every hacker has their own ethic.
       
     I think the problem we're all having is the fact that everyone is
     deluding themselves thinking there is only ONE 'hacker ethic'. The
     truth of the matter is, everyone has their *OWN* hacker 'ethic'. To
     say that we all think the same way is foolish.[42]
    4. Anti-professionalism Ethics are usually professional standards; by
       their very nature hackers are anti-professional and tend to make
       up the rules as they go along. Creating a professional, formalized
       code for hackers would mean the end of hacking.
    5. Natural Evolution The hacker ethic, like any belief system, must
       evolve over time; it's foolish to assume anyone could maintain the
       same ethics when everything else (especially technology) changes
       so rapidly.
       
   In exploring some of the factors that lead to rejection of the
   original Hacker Ethic, we might be able to understand better why
   certain hackers do embrace either the old or new one or a combination
   of both.
   
  Investigations of Patterns
  
   I did two index tree searches of the NUDIST tree-index to examine my
   hypothesis of continuity between the 60s and 90s hackers.
   
  Report 1
  
   This was simply an index search where I told NUDIST to identify the
   number of documents which contained codes from both the old and new
   hacker ethics' subcodes. Any document which contained one or more
   codes from both sets of ethical codes was considered a 'hit,'
   indicating knowledge of (if not practice) of both systems. The results
   were: retrievals in 15 out of 29 documents or 52 percent. This seems
   to be statistically significant, and it is unlikely that hackers would
   express elements of both ethical systems purely by chance unless they
   were aware of both.
   
  Report 2
  
   I generated a matrix of overlapping documents for the Hacker Ethics
   (old and new). This identifies where codes co-occur within the same
   text units (as opposed to elsewhere in the same text) and in which
   documents.
   
   1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6
   2 1 24 24, 18
   2 2
   2 3
   2 4
   2 5
   2 6
   2 7
   2 8 27 27
   2 9
   2 10
   
   In document 24, "hacker vs. cracker," we see the co-occurence of the
   old hacker ethic of "total access" and the new hacker ethic of "do no
   harm," as well as the co-occurence of "information wants to be free"
   with "do no harm." In document 18, "Hacker ethic jargon file," we see
   the co-occurence of these same sentiments. And in document 27, "Rebels
   with a cause," we see the co-occurence of "self defense" with
   "information wants to be free" and "computers can change your life for
   the better."
   
   Apparently, while hackers may express principles of both hacker
   ethics, they are unlikely to do so at the same time or within the same
   thought. Co-occurence within the same text unit did not occur very
   often - only 3 out of 29 documents.
   
  Conclusions - areas for future research
  
   I feel it safe to say that I can conclude a few basic facts from this
   early effort at text analysis. Mostly, I have a basis for a good deal
   of future research. I might be able to state more, if I had access to
   more documents or more information about their authors beyond their
   "handles."
   
    1. New 90s hackers are not unethical. They are not unaware of the
       original Hacker Ethic. They have their own ethical system which
       combines elements of the old 60s Hacker Ethic with some new
       innovations (the new hacker ethic.) The fact that ethics are
       important to these hackers is suggested by the fact that they
       anethematize "crackers" and "dark side" hackers for transgressions
       which violate the spirit of their ethics.
    2. There are four interesting areas of investigation for looking into
       the changes between the old and new Hacker Ethic. Measurement of
       changes in computer technology, social indicators, computer
       industry practices, and generational demographics might provide
       variables which covary with, and possibly even explain, the
       changes in this ideological system.
    3. Some new hackers do repudiate the original Hacker Ethic or the
       possibility of having an ethic at all. It would be interesting to
       find out what aspects of their profiles (age, background,
       experience, gender, social class, etc.) correlate with whether or
       not they repudiate it and why. There should be some way to predict
       whether or not a hacker is likely to embrace the ethic, and how
       much they fidelity to it they will demonstrate.
    4. The (old and new) Hacker Ethic is not totally idiosyncratic.
       Elements of it are similar to principles advocated by American
       culture and its "democratic" constitutional and informal ideals;
       the ethical codes of professional organizations such as academics,
       doctors, and lawyers; the ethical systems of "underground" and
       marginalized groups such as addicts, prostitutes, homeless people,
       etc.; and traditional ethical precepts of philosophy (such as the
       Golden Rule or Kantian categorical imperative.) Hackers are not
       alone in wanting privacy, knowledge, or community.
    5. The similarity between the old and new hacker ethics suggest that
       the new hackers did not emerge out of a distinct "tradition" from
       the old hackers. Ethical continuity suggests some demographic
       continuity. The 60s and 90s hackers may not be all that different,
       despite the fact that the 60s hackers consider the 90s hackers to
       be less deserving of the mantle of the term "hacker."
