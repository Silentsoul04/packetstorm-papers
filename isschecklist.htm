<h1>Security Mechanisms</h1>

<P>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Security Deployment&#133; What
to consider</b></p>

<p>Before Deploying an effective security
mechanism, consider the following:</p>

<p>1. What resources are you trying to protect?</p>

<ul>
    <li>CPU, files, storage devices phone lines,
        etc&#133;</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Determine the host-specific security
measures needed. Password protection, file encryption, firewall,
etc&#133;</p>

<ul>
    <li>Determine who the computer systems must be
        defended.</li>
    <li>Determine the likelihood of a threat.</li>
    <li>Implement measures to protect network
        resource.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. Consider
the corporate budget when planning for Internet Security.</p>

<p>4. Design a
Security Policy that describes your organization's network
security concerns. This policy should take into account the
following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Network Security Planning</li>
    <li>Site Security Policy</li>
    <li>Risk Analysis</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>Risk analysis involves determining the
    following:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>What you need to protect</li>
        <li>What you need to protect it from</li>
        <li>How to protect it</li>
        <li>Estimating the risk of losing the
            resource</li>
        <li>Estimating the importance of the
            resource</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>5. Consider
the following factors to determine who will grant access to
services on your networks:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Will access to services be granted from a
        central point?</li>
    <li>What methods will you use to create
        accounts and terminate access?</li>
</ul>

<p>6. Design
and Implement Packet Filter Rules</p>

<p>7. Ensure your Firewall has the following
properties:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All traffic from inside to outside, as
        well as outside to inside must pass through the firewall.</li>
    <li>Allow only authorized traffic as defined
        by your corporate security policy be passed through the
        firewall.</li>
    <li>Ensure the firewall is immune to
        penetration.</li>
</ul>

<p>8. Educate users about password protection:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Educating users not to use passwords that
        are easy to guess.</li>
    <li>Ensuring the password lengths are
        adequate.</li>
    <li>Running a password guesser.</li>
    <li>Requiring the use of a password generator.</li>
    <li>Always using a mixture of upper- and
        lowercase characters.</li>
    <li>Always using at least one or two
        non-alphanumeric characters.</li>
    <li>Never using dictionary words or ones
        spelled backwards.</li>
    <li>Never using a portion or variation of a
        proper name, address or anything that could obviously
        identify you (the user).</li>
</ul>

<p>9. Security-related
organizations play an integral role in the development and
deployment of Internet technologies. Keep abreast of the latest
in security-related activities by visiting their Web sites. Here
are some key security-rated organizations which aid corporations
such as yours in keeping the Internet a safer place to compute:</p>

<p><b>Important Internet Security
Issues</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Authentication:<br>
    </b>There are two types of authentication:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>1) TCP/IP (such as Telnet and
        FTP.TCP/IP and</p>
        <p>2) Messages, transactions and E-mail
        that require authentication of source.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>Confidentiality:<br>
    </b>Encryption provides security for private or secret
    information included in E-mail, FTP and electronic commerce.</p>
    <p><b>Data Integrity:<br>
    </b>Assures that data has not been altered during
    transmission over the Internet and protects FTP or E-mail
    files for transmission over the Internet.</p>
    <p><b>Proof of Origin:<br>
    </b>Protects against the sender falsely denying sending the
    data or the recipient from falsely denying receiving the
    data.</p>
    <p><b>Internet Access:<br>
    </b>A gateway may be required to intercept and examine
    messages from and to the Internet.</p>
