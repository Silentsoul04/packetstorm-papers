<H1>FAQ: Firewall Admins Guide to Porn</H1>

	One of the more frequent problem security administrators
	will face is porn. It is a popular Internet application,
	and even when restrictions are put into place, users
	find ways of getting around them. At the same time,
	users tend to be clueless as to the knowledge
	firewall admins have of their surfing habits.
	Every administrator of a large company that I know
	of has had to confront this issue, but not much is
	discussed about the topic in the literature.
	<P>
	This document is intended as a guide for firewall
	admins in this area.

<DT><H1>1. General Guide (non technical)</H1><DD>


	<DT><H2>1.1 What the end user should know</H2><DD>

	<TABLE WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="right" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="8"><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC"><B>Anecdote</B></TD></TR>
	<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><SMALL>
		At one time I worked for Network General on the Sniffer(tm) Network Analyzer.
		A new utility under developement would sniff the URLs off the
		wire, put them into a database, and ship them up to
		the "SniffMaster" console.
		<P>
		We naturally test on our own network, and were immediately
		confronted with URLs that were obviously porn sites, being
		surfed during work hours. Many of these users were also
		higher level employees (managers and above).
		While the company had no policy <I>per se</I> against it, 
		it obviously wasn't good. It also made the engineers nervous,
		because they didn't want to know such things.
		<P>
		The CTO at the time sent out a pretty good e-mail on the
		subject. Basically, he clarified that Network General had the highest concentration
		of network monitoring equipment in the world, simply for developement purposes. 
		Therefore, if somebody
		had surfing habits they didn't want other to know about, then
		they shouldn't surf at work.
		<P>
		Personally, I thought it would be a good intelligence test --
		if they surfed porn sites at Network General, then they
		obviously weren't too intelligent.
	</SMALL></TD></TR></TABLE>

	<P>
	The first problem firewall admins face is educating clueless end-users as 
	to the scope of their powers. Users tend to think the Internet is unmonitored,
	or that monitoring their activity would be illegal or immoral.
	Also, they never hear of other people getting caught -- so they think
	they will not get caught. They need to understand that their
	Internet use <I>is</I> monitored, and that even if they
	don't get "caught" (i.e. fired, etc.), they will be found out.
	Many firewall admins simply don't have the time nor inclination
	to pursue the matter. They will know, but they simply won't 
	tell anybody.


	<P>
	The first step in communicating this issue to end-users is to
	explain to them that all traffic incoming/outgoing
	traffic is monitored for security purposes. There exists a "firewall"
	through which all traffic passes, which attempts to restrict
	hacker attempts. Thise "firewall" logs all connections, and
	the administrators frequently review those logs in order 
	catch those hacking attempts. If they are surfing porn sites,
	the firewall admin will also accidentally see that as well.
	The company may not be looking for such things, but they will
	accidently find it.
	
	<P>

	The long an the short of it is: if you are surfing porn at work,
	somebody knows. Just because they haven't talked to you about
	it doesn't mean they don't know. They probably are just to
	uncomfortable to tell you about it.

	<P>


	<DT><H2>1.2 What managers should know</H2><DD>

		<TABLE WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="right" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="8"><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC"><B>Tidbit</B></TD></TR>
		<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><SMALL>
			It is often the managers, all the way up to the CEO, who are the worst
			offenders. They feel that since they are at such high levels,
			they don't have to play by the rules. This makes administrators
			afraid of the higher-ups finding out what they
			known -- and getting squished.
		</SMALL></TD></TR></TABLE>

		Porn surfing isn't necessarily a problem.
		Sure, it wastes a bit of time, but surfing
		news, sports, weather, etc. also waste time.
		Porn shouldn't be disallowed for this reason
		(though you may have other policies against
		wasting corporate time).
		<P>
		Many companies have official policies against
		knowing about monitoring for porn for legal reasons. This sounds
		strange, but here is how it works: If you monitor content,
		then you become liable for content. In this area, ignorance
		generally is a good excuse. The best example of this
		are Yahoo message boards on stock information. Yahoo
		intentionally does not monitor content on these boards.
		End-users have posted slander and knowingly false rumours
		in attempts to manipulate stock prices. By not monitoring
		such things, Yahoo is blameless in much the same manner
		that the phone companies and ISPs are blameless in sending
		that traffic over the wire. Legally, it just transfers
		information among users.
		<P>
		AOL experienced this many years back. They got sued over
		some content, because they partially <I>monitored</I> the content.
		They were therefore found <I>responsible</I> for the content.
		AOLs response was to cease monitoring most of its
		message boards, and only monitored specific message boards
		(for kids).
		<P>
		

	<DT><H2>1.3 What firewall admins should know</H2><DD>

		<TABLE WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="right" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="8"><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC"><B>Anecdote</B></TD></TR>
		<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><SMALL>
			A major financial institution has no official policy
			for/against porn, and officially does not monitor
			employee net usage (for much those reasons mentioned
			above).
			<P>
			However, technicians are constantly seeing evidence
			of porn. This makes them very uncomfortable, because
			it is often high-level VPs doing the surfing. This
			makes them scared for their jobs, and they put informal
			processes in place in order to delete the information
			or not collect it. Therefore, when they evaluate
			new network management products, they prefer products
			that do not have porn-sniffing features, or ones
			where such features can be easily disabled.
		</SMALL></TD></TR></TABLE>

		Firewall admins see porn surfing all the time,
		whether or not companies have regulations against it.
		The first question they have is "I've found porn,
		what should I do now?".
		<P>
		Most are reluctent to do anything. This is HR (Human Resources)
		job, not theirs. In particular, reporting such information
		doesn't help their job, but can put them into great jeopardy.
		For example, if they find a VP surfing porn sites against
		company regulations, there is a better chance of them
		losing their jobs than the VP.
		<P>
		Monitoring people is a very senstive issue, even when done
		accidentally. Even though it the network, the computer,
		and even people's time is technically "owned" by the company,
		the employees rarely see it this way. If someone gets
		fired for porn, it will generate a lot of ill will -- especially
		toward the people who discovered it.


	<DT><H2>1.4 A good solution</H2><DD>

		The best solution I've heard of is the following: Log access
		to all sites, then publish the log in a web page. The
		log should include <I>who</I> is accessing <I>what</I>
		web pages.
		<P>
		This solution has a number of benefits. 
		<UL>
		<LI>Instead of using
			technology to fight a social problem, it uses
			a social solution to fight the problem.
		<LI>The company has a whole doesn't need to have a policy
			against porn -- employees will decide for themselves
			what it is appropriate to view.
		<LI>It is self regulating. The employee knows that everyone
			else will know what they are doing, and will decide
			accordingly. Even simple time wasting on the Internet
			will be reduced.
		<LI>Alieves most of the social/legal problems with "spying".
			The firewall/security/network admins themselves
			aren't officially looking at the logs -- just everyone
			else in the company is.
		</UL>
		<P>
		The biggest problem with this is false positives. For example,
		there was a security article on Playboy.com that I went to
		because it popped up in an AltaVista search result. Some 
		pr0n spam messages contain hyperlinks to images on the net,
		which will show up. However, generally it is easy to
		tell the difference between an "accident" that shows up once
		or twice compared to an on-going clear abuse.
	

<DT><H1>2. How they will be caught</H1><DD>

		Firewall admins, IDS admins, network managers,
		and desktop managers are constantly seeing evidence of
		porn.


	<DT><H2>2.1 Packet Filter logs</H2><DD>

		A popular type of firewall is the "packet filter".
		Most routers nowadays support packet filtering
		and logging.
		<P>
		This traps porn use in two ways. The first is simply
		that <I>all</I> connections are logged, telling the
		firewall admin who in the company was surfing which
		site. Secondly, many companies block well-known porn
		sites. <B>Denied</B> connections are placed in a separate
		log that admins are more likely to see. (Firewall
		admins typically don't have time to review the first
		log, but often glance over the second log).

		<EXAMPLE>

		
	<DT><H2>2.2 Proxy logs</H2><DD>
		<P>
		Proxy are a different type of firewalls. They essentially
		stop all Internet traffic at the box, then re-generate
		the original requests. As far as the Internet sees,
		all the requests come from the proxy, not from the
		end-user.
		<P>
		Not only does this boost security, it also increases
		performance. If multiple users want the access the 
		same file on the Internet, the proxy only needs to get
		it once -- then "caches" it on its hard disk for 
		each subsequent access by other users.
		<P>
		Like firewalls, they log all the sites they visit.
		Administrators reviewing such data for fault/performance
		reasons will often come across pr0n.

	<DT><H2>2.3 Sniffers</H2><DD>

		<TABLE WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="right" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="8"><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC"><B>Anecdote</B></TD></TR>
		<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><SMALL>
			In the early 1990s before HTTP/HTML, the primary front-end for 
			Internet was text-based with things like Telnet, FTP, and so 
			on.
			<P>
			During this time I created a Telnet/rlogin session monitor
			that would watch sessions on the wire and dump the contents
			to the appropriate terminal emulator. This allowed me
			list all current sessions, then view a snapshot of the 
			same thing the user was seeing on their screen. During developement,
			I was essentially forced to
			watch another engineer nearby who Telnetted daily out of the
			company to another computer to read Usenet B&D groups.
			Again, the biggest pr0n problem is the embarrassment it
			causes us who find out about it.
		</SMALL></TD></TR></TABLE>

		Network managers (not just security managers) will
		frequently put "sniffers" (wiretaps) on the network
		in order to see what is going on. The main purpose
		of these devices is to solve problems (like why
		two devices can't talk, or why the network is slow).
		<P>
		There are many kinds of sniffing programs.
		<DL>
		<DT>RMON<DD>These are remote probes placed around
			the network. They log all TCP/IP connections (RMONv2)
			and send that information to a centralized console.
		<DT>DSS (Distrbuted Sniffer System) from NAI<DD>Much the	
			same as RMONv2, these will monitor not only
			connections but will also pull URLs off the
			wire and send them to a centralized console.
		<DT>IDS<DD>Like from Network ICE, ISS, Axent, or NAI.
			These programs constantly sniff the wire looking
			for intrusions, then report them to a centralized
			console. They don't necessarily monitor <I>all</I>
			connections, but they will report suspicious
			ones up to a centralized console.
		</DL>
		<P>
		See <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/sniffing-faq.html">http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/sniffing-faq.html</A>
		for more information on packet sniffers.
		

	<DT><H2>2.4 DNS cache</H2><DD>

		Most companies setup their own DNS servers to resolve names in to
		addresses (i.e. "www.microsoft.com" might resolve to "192.0.2.128").
		In order to improve performance, these servers "cache" requests.
		<P>
		For example, when you load the URL "http://www.robertgraham.com", you
		first ask your local DNS server for the corresponding IP address.
		The DNS server "resolves" that address for you by sending a query
		across the Internet to my DNS server. The second time you ask for this
		address (or when somebody else in your same company asks for it), the
		DNS server has remembered it and responds immediately, without
		sending a second request across the Internet to my server.
		<P>
		An administrator of a DNS server will occasionally come across this
		cache when administering the server. They won't know exactly who
		surfed "www.robertgraham.com", but they will know somebody in the
		organization has.
		<P>
		For example, the DNS server that I use for my website <I>and</I>
		my outgoing traffic will show the 
		following hierarchy:
		<UL>
		 <LI>robertgraham.com
			<UL>
			 <LI>www
			 <LI>ftp
			</UL>
		 <LI>Cache
			<UL>
			 <LI>com
				<UL>
				 <LI>microsoft
					<UL>
					 <LI>www
					 <LI>support
					</UL>
				 <LI>yahoo
					<UL>
					 <LI>www
					 <LI>my
					</UL>
				</UL>
			</UL>
		</UL>
		In the first section, you can tell that my DNS server will respond to queries
		from the Internet for "www.robertgraham.com" and "ftp.robertgraham.com".
		In the second section, you can tell that I've recently visited the 
		sites: www.microsoft.com, support.microsoft.com, www.yahoo.com, my.yahoo.com.

	<DT><H2>2.5 Browser histories and cookies</H2><DD>
		<TABLE WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="right" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="8"><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC"><B>Anecdote</B></TD></TR>
		<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><SMALL>
			One time I was reviewing the cookie list with a co-worker
			on her machine, and one of them was from an obvious porn
			site. I am pretty sure this was because of me -- I work
			in security, and sometimes surf hacker sites to research
			information. In the past (though less so now), hackers put
			lots of porn advertising banners on their sites in order
			to earn money. While re-installing software on my machine,
			I may have used her machine for research -- and may have
			visited a hacker site that pulled a banner from a porn
			site that put a cookie on her machine. (This was in
			an environment where we regularly use each other's machines).
		</SMALL></TD></TR></TABLE>

		One simple way employees reveal their surfing habits to
		other employees is the "smart completion" feature of 
		newer browsers. The URL line at the top of the browser contains
		a drop-down list box of recently visited sites, and will
		"auto-complete" for you. As a user selects a URL or types
		one partially in, a past URL of a porn site will inadvertently
		appear. People standing over their shoulder will accidentally
		see this.
		<P>
		Most browsers keep a list of all the URLs that a user has
		browsed. A few clicks of the button will open this list.
		Again, a user can easily accidentally open this list by clicking
		on the wrong location, again exposing the list to people
		standing nearby.
		<P>
		Similarly, sites will drop cookies on your machine. If you open
		your cookie list you will probably see hundreds of cookies left
		on your machine. Mostly, these sites are attempting to track
		you. They place icons on other pages, and match the HTTP "Referer"
		field with the cookie. They don't necessarily know who you
		are, but they do know where you've been. Porn sites are very big
		into various browser tricks, such as using JavaScript to open
		infinite number of pages or using cookies to track you online.
		It is very easty to accidentally acquire some porn cookies on
		your machine, as I describe in the anecdote for this section.
		

	<DT><H2>2.6 Browser cache</H2><DD>

		<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><SMALL>
			One day, I come into work, sit down at my machine
			and use it as normal. However, I find some weird
			programs in the Windows "Start" menu. One was 
			called "Live View", and the other called "Sex Chat".
			<P>
			Alarm bells start ringing in my head, of course.
			I start all sorts of complicated plans to catch the culprit,
			but unfortunately it was much easier than that.
			<P>
			The first thing I did was <CODE>dir /s /b *.jpg</CODE>
			in my browser cache directory. Sure enough, I saw
			lots and lots of files with names like "busty.jpg".
			Furthermore, the timestamps of the files were always
			for about 5-10 minutes around 4:15 am and 5:00 am
			going back a couple of weeks.
			I deduced that this must be the security guard. On his
			rounds, he drops by my office and surfs porn.
			<P>
			Among the many stupid things he did was to
			write down 900 numbers onto a pad of Post It notes,
			which leaves an indentation in the underlying notes.
			This gave me a sample of his handwriting. I went
			and found the current security guard on duty
			(this was a weekend) and match the hand writing
			with the previous security guards report. This
			nightly report also showed the schedule for the
			security guard's rounds.
			<P>
			I communicated the incident to the facilities admin and got the guy
			fired. I felt so violated (I am a geek after all), they
			guard betrayed the companies trust, he may have been
			reading proprietary info off my machine, and there
			is no telling what kind of viruses or trojans he
			could have accidentally downloaded. Personally, I feel
			that being a guard is a lonely job, and that the
			company should just provide him a machine for his desk :-)
			so that he won't feel impelled to borrow other machines.

	<P>
	In much the same way that proxies (see above) cache files on the
	hard disk, web browsers will also save files. This means
	that every time a user visits the same web page, the web
	browser doesn't need to go across the Internet and download
	the same file again, dramatically speeding up web access.
	<P>
	The primary admin who comes across these caches is the 
	<B>desktop technician</B>. They frequently make house
	calls to desktop machines, or work with the machines
	inside their labs. Automated backups sometimes pull
	down these directories accidentally, meaning the backup
	tapes are filled with porn.
	<P>
	Even when the user take pains to bypass monitoring software,
	encrypt their connections over SSL, or go through
	anonymous browsing service, the files will always get
	saved to the disk. If the user can view it, then it is more
	than likely the system has saved it to disk somewhere.
	<P>
	Even deleting the cache doesn't always get rid of the files.
	There are many ways to recover lost files, depending upon
	how much effort you are willing to go to. The first step
	would be built in undelete programs. The next would be
	disk scanners (which disregard directory entries and pull
	data directly from the disk). Those two method rely upon
	the fact that the files have been forgotten about, but 
	not overwritten. However, a third method can sometimes
	recover overwritten files. Even when things are overwritten,
	magnetic traces of the original data are left behind.
	This is why spies and the DoD recommend overwritting free
	space at least 7 times in order to completely erase
	old data. Such "wipe" features come as part of many
	encyption packages.

	<DT><H2>2.7 E-mail messages</H2><DD>

	<P>
	Most users do not realize how often e-mail is misdirected.
	Mistyping the destination address often results in the e-mail
	being forwarded to the postmaster of the destination domain.
	This means that your e-mail may be read, even though nobody
	is actively monitoring it.
	<P>
	Likewise, some companies do monitor e-mail. Many log headers in order
	to track messages over time, others will store the entire contents
	of text messages.
	<P>
		<TABLE WIDTH="50%" XALIGN="right" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="8"><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC"><B>Anecdote</B></TD></TR>

			I maintain e-mail for a domain that is similar to a company
			in the United Kingdom (like "example.com" vs. "example.co.uk").
			I get a fair amount of misdirected e-mail, 80% of which
			is porn related (both text and images).
			<P>
			One of the messages was:
			<PRE>
I'll be away now for 8 weeks and will be having my mail intercepted by
our receptionist who is the kind of person who would have me sacked for
the type of mail that I've been receiving lately, so could you please
not send me any messages until I return.

I look forward to seeing you (and my job!) on my return.
</PRE>
			<P>
			I am still curious as to the statistical significance
			of the quantity of porn I receive this way. Since the sender
			also receives a report that the e-mail address is wrong,
			they rarely make the mistake twice. Furthermore, there
			are about 30 different recipients in that company that
			I've seen. Statistically, it seems that everyone is 
			sending/receiving porn all the time!

From <A HREF="http://www.nfr.net/firewall-wizards/mail-archive/1999/Jun/0237.html">http://www.nfr.net/firewall-wizards/mail-archive/1999/Jun/0237.html</A><DD>
<PRE>
Hey folks. First of all, obligatory thanks to all of you; reading your
discussions have helped me at my job tremendously, in providing a fairly
vendor independent perspecive on realistic security implementations. so
thanks, y'all.

I'd like to add that I feel it takes both types of involvement, for a
company to really implement a viable safeguard against liability for
illegal/inappropriate access. At my organization, we had a rather
unfortunate case of idiocy, which, although it didn't do much damage
prompted us to invoke some limitations on web traffic. We used a combination
of router based and independent software solutions to restrict access to a
list of categories of url's, and track and log all access.  Using this,
along with periodic human log reading, we are able to decide if we need to
have reiterate the companies web browsing policy (which we TRY to ensure
employees are aware of when they are hired, although whose to say what they
ACTUALLY read in this day of quick signatures). The policy has been used to
discipline several employees, and we saw a growing degree of awareness of
the policy, as warnings have been issued about excessive non-work related
browsing.

We are, however, a smaller organization so this is feasible. I do not think
the work scales well, as the larger the organization the more segments to
monitor, the more access points you'll have, and the more general network
chatter you're going to have. All in all, I'd say its a waste of time,
actually, but The People Who Decide Things wanted it, and I actually enjoyed
setting it up in a sick sort of Control Freak way.  

Anyways, that is all. Just thought I'd share; ultimately, the technology is
only going to aid you in enforcing a strong policy, and that takes not only
the will to enforce a policy, and the technology to make it tricky enough to
break that the attempt alone, which is logged, constitutes a clear desire to
break it and not an accident.
