How to use it?
This can pose as the installation program for a game. This means that
when you upload it to a BBS or something, and post that it is a
kickass game, people will download it and try to install it on their
computers!

What does it do?
This program changes directory to the root and makes 100000 dirs in
the root.  You cannot use deltree to wipe them out in one chunk and
you CANNOT get rid of them without doing reverse engineering on the
program, ie. rd instead of md.  To get rid of them any other way you
would have to format c: or d:
