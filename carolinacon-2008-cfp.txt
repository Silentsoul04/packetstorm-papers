InfoSec professionals, h4x0rs, script kidz, posers, and government spies:

"CarolinaCon" is back yet again! Yes, for about the price of your average
movie admission with popcorn and a drink, YOU are invited to join us for
yet another intimate and informative weekend of technology education.

What is this "CarolinaCon"?
CarolinaCon is an annual Technology Conference whose mission/purpose is
to;
- enhance local and global awareness of current technology issues and
developments,
- provide affordable technology education sessions to the unwashed masses,
- deliver varied/informative/interesting presentations on a wide variety
of InfoSec/hacking/technology/science topics, and
- mix in enough entertainment and side contests/challenges to make for a
truly fun event.

When/Where is CarolinaCon?
This year's event will be held on the weekend of March 28th-30th, 2008.
The event will mostly occur at the Holiday Inn in Chapel Hill, NC. Chapel
Hill is about 30 minutes from Raleigh, Durham, and Research Triangle Park.

Who develops/delivers CarolinaCon?
CarolinaCon is proudly brought to you by "The CarolinaCon Group". The
CarolinaCon Group is a non-profit organization registered in the state of
NC, dedicated to educating the local and global communities about
technology, information/network/computer security, and information rights.
The CarolinaCon Group is also closely associated with various "2600"
chapters across NC, SC, TN, VA, LA, DC, and NY. Many of the volunteers who
help develop and deliver CarolinaCon come from those chapters.

What events will be at CarolinaCon?
CarolinaCon is mainly about the talks (presentations/demos). Alongside of
those we'll surely have several other technology-related contests/challenges,
as we've had in past years. Details on those will be announced soon.

Who will be presenting which topics this year?
That's where YOU possibly come in. If you are somewhat knowledgeable in
some interesting field of technology, hacking, science, etc., and are
interested in speaking/presenting at CarolinaCon, we invite you to submit
your proposal (in brief) for our review. If you're interested in
presenting please send;
- your name or handle,
- the topic/presentation name,
- estimated time-length of presentation, and
- a brief topic abstract
....via e-mail to:
speakers <at> carolinacon.org

*NOTE: All submissions are due BY mid-January 2008! Last year we unfortunately
had more submissions than time-slots and "first come first affirmed", so be
timely in submission if you're committed to being part of the elite cadre of
presenters.

Unfortunately as a non-profit dedicated to affordable education, we've
made "less than $100 total profit" each of the past years and can't afford
to pay anyone to speak nor cover any related expenses (sorry). However if
you do speak at the Con, you will receive;
- free Con admission,
- a free Con t-shirt,
- an invitation to a private soiree during the conference,
- minimal fame and glory, and
- mad props from staff and attendees

We value diversity, so please don't hesitate to propose your ideas no
matter how outlandish.

I'm excited! What do I do know?
If you're interested in speaking, send the 411 requested to:
speakers <at> carolinacon.org
(BY/BEFORE January 15th 2008)

And if you're interested in attending, watch this space for more details:

...and don't forget to mark the dates on your calendar!

Peace,
Vic
