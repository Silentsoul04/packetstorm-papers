FEDERAL INTERNETWORKING PANEL ISSUES FINAL REPORT
In its May 1994 report, the Federal Internetworking Requirements
Panel (FIRP) concluded that no single networking protocol suite
meets the full range of government requirements for data
internetworking.  Established by NIST to recommend actions which
the federal government can take to address the issues of
interworking and convergence of networking protocols, the FIRP
recommended that federal agencies select standards based on their
interoperability needs, existing infrastructure, costs,
marketplace products, and status as standards.

Paper copies of the report are available from Joan Wyrwa, Tech.

Patent Agreement Reached in Federal Use of Key Escrow Encryption 
CSL has reached a licensing agreement in principle with Silvio
Micali of Brookline, Massachusetts, for two of his inventions
that relate to key escrow encryption.  In February 1994, the
Secretary of Commerce approved Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS) 185, Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES), as a
voluntary key escrow encryption system which provides strong
security for voice, fax, and data communications over telephone
lines while allowing lawful government access.  The agreement in
principle grants the government non-exclusive licenses to
Micali's patented inventions for current implementations of the
escrowed key process -- including those generally known as
Clipper and Capstone technologies -- and for future
implementations that may be developed using those inventions.  

Office of Enterprise Integration Established
NIST has established a new Office of Enterprise Integration (OEI)
within CSL to serve as a focal point for efforts throughout the
NIST laboratories that provide technical underpinnings for
applications of information technology in areas such as
manufacturing, construction, healthcare, and government services. 
The OEI will provide an initial point of contact for policy
makers and researchers in industry, academia, and government
interested in learning more about NIST activities related to
enterprise integration and electronic commerce.  

For further information, contact the Office of Enterprise
Integration, Computer Systems Laboratory, NIST, Bldg. 415, Room
102, Gaithersburg, MD 20899; telephone (301) 975-4529; fax (301)
948-7242.  

FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARDS (FIPS) ACTIVITIES
Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) Revised
The Secretary of Commerce recently approved a revision of FIPS
173, SDTS, to be published as FIPS 173-1.  The standard provides
specifications for the organization and structure of digital
spatial data transfer, definition of spatial features and
attributes, and data transfer encoding; the revision adds
Topological Vector Profile (TVP) to these specifications.  To be
effective December 30, 1994, FIPS 173-1 will facilitate the
transfer of digital spatial data between dissimilar computer
systems.

FIPS Proposed for Application Profile for the Government
Information Locator Service (GILS)
The proposed FIPS for GILS describes an application profile based
primarily on the American National Standard for Information
Retrieval Application Service Definition and Protocol
specification for Open Systems Interconnection (ANSI/NISO Z39.50-
1992), developed by the National Information Standards
Organization.  GILS is a decentralized collection of servers and
associated information services that will be used by the public
either directly or through intermediaries to find public
information throughout the federal government.

We are interested in learning the views of federal agencies,
vendors, and the public on the proposed GILS standard, copies of
which are available through our FIPS Office at (301) 975-2816. 
Address your written comments to Director, CSL, ATTN:  Proposed
FIPS for GILS, Tech. Bldg, B-154, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. 
The comment period ends October 3, 1994.

Proposed Revision of FIPS 125-1, MUMPS
A proposed revision of FIPS 125-1, MUMPS (Massachusetts General
Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System), known as M, would
adopt the revised voluntary industry specifications ANSI/MDC
X11.1-199X.  The American National Standard for M specifies the
form and establishes the interpretation of programs written in
the M programming language.  

To be received by October 3, 1994, written comments should be
addressed to the Director, CSL, ATTN:  Proposed FIPS 125-2, M,
Tech. Bldg., B-154, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.  You may
purchase a copy of the technical specifications (ANSI/MDC X11.1-
199X) from the MUMPS Development Committee Secretariat, 1738
Elton Road, Suite 205, Silver Spring, MD 20903, (301) 431-4070,
fax (301) 431-0017.  

FIPS 119, Ada, Being Revised
A proposed revision to FIPS 119, Ada, would adopt the revised
voluntary industry specifications, American National Standard and
the International Organization for Standardization Reference
Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994. 
The revised standard specifies the form and meaning of programs
written in Ada.  

Copies of the technical specifications may be obtained from the
Ada 9X Mapping/Revision Team, Intermetrics, Inc., 733 Concord
Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02138, (617) 661-1840.  Address written
comments to the Director, CSL, ATTN:  Proposed FIPS 119-1, Ada,
Tech. Bldg., B-154, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, by October 11,
1994.

Advanced Data Communications Control Procedures Withdrawn
FIPS 71, Advanced Data Communications Control Procedures (ADCCP),
and FIPS 78, Guideline for Implementing Advanced Data
Communications Control Procedures (ADCCP), have been withdrawn.
The technical specifications contained in these FIPS are obsolete
and are no longer supported by industry.
