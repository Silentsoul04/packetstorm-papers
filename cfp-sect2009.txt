CFP for SEC-T 2009 - Embedded & Ubiquitous Computing

This year, the SEC-T technical security conference will revolve around the fact that computing today permeates everyday life and how information security is effected by this. The 10th and 11th of September we want you to challenge your perceptions and see beyond the mundane veneer of life and hack the fabric that lies beneath.

We are currently accepting speech proposals (60min, english language) for the second annual SEC-T conference in Stockholm, Sweden. If you have a security related topic you would like to present at the conference, please send a short description of the content to cfp@sec-t.org along with a brief biography. As usual selected speakers will be reimbursed for travel and hotel costs.

There is no deadline set for proposals yet but as time goes more and more speaker slots will be filled, so be sure to submit your proposal as soon as possible!

Please visit the SEC-T website at http://www.sec-t.org/ for more information about the SEC-T technical security conference.
