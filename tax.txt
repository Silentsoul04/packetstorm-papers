THC 10th Anniversary Party Information 
======================================

We are more than happy to invite you to TAX - the 10th anniversary of
The Hacker's Choice (THC) - a 4 day event in Berlin, Germany bringing
together the "who-is-who" for fun and no profit.

Please read the whole email, there is lots of important information.
The current TAX schedule is as follows:


FRIDAY
======

  Midday+Afternoon
    For people arriving Thursday or Friday morning, we will organize a
    Hacker Paper Chase through Berlin featuring nice locations and cool
    riddles.

  Night
    THC Dinner - we will visit a nice, stylish restaurant and have a
    good time.  Cocktail Bar and Disco follow.


SATURDAY
========

  Midday+Afternoon
    We will do a sightseeing tour through Berlin by Bus and Boat. For
    hackers and alike this will be the first chance to perform
    "warboating" and "warbusing". The rest of the crowd, including boy-
    and girlfriends, can enjoy one of the most beautiful sides of
    Berlin. (This will cost money, however we will negotiate a cheap
    group price beforehand)

  Night
    The real TAX party! On 1st of October The Hacker's Choice (THC)
    will become 10 years old. Whoop it out with THC. Everyone is
    invited to party, celebrate and dance. There will be DJs, drinks,
    you can have food if you are hungry and lots of surprises and
    special acts! Don't forget to bring your boy- and girlfriends.


SUNDAY
======

  Midday 
    The famous THC brunch - As after every CCC congress or Ph-Neutral
    conference, we will have one of our famous brunch events on Sunday. 
    Relax at a nice restaurant with reserved area and great food.

  Afternoon/Night
    Tropical Island - Some people are canceling their holiday just to
    come to our party, staying away from beautiful beaches and the sun.
    It is October, however we will give you the same. 

    http://www.my-tropical-islands.com/ is the biggest hall in Europe
    which was made a tropical resort, looking everything like Bali. Its
    HUGE, has real beaches, high temperatures and you can actually camp
    at the beach over night if you want to!  Optional agenda: They have
    some WLANs and a credit card like payment system ... *grin*


MONDAY
======

  Afternoon
    For everybody who would like to participate in a coding
    marathon: we will organize a Coding Challenge. The design for code
    packages for a new hacking tool will be evenly distributed between
    coders, so that we can code over the day.  In the end we will put
    all parts together and have a cool new THC tool which everybody
    participated in. More information on the hacking tool will follow.

  Night
    Closing and chilling out at a nice cocktail lounge. End of party.
    See you again in 10 years :-)


TRAVELING
=========

We will organize a central and nice hotel for everybody with a very
cheap rate. Please contact Escher (escher@thc.org) if you need a room,
as he is doing the negotiation.

================

In the first or second week of September you will receive further more
information on TAX. Additionally you will get the option to confirm
