New[bie] Hacker Website Reference Guide    (v1.0)

By st3v3n_g@yahoo.com a.k.a. fú®bÿ 


Now these past couple of months, elitehackers.com has been getting alot of newbies to the board.
Some are actually willing to learn, and others are only script-kiddies & lamers.  I have 
compiled a little guide that should be able to help the "sprouting-seed hacker".  I hope you 
enjoy this and I will probably be making other versions after this.
