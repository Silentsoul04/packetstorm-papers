      THE .AWARE-ELECTROLICIOUS-ZINE CALL FOR PAPERS
                                       DELTA EDITION

The .aware delta zine is going to be released on the
1st of April in 2009 (or is it?). As always, we need
your articles, drug recipes and holiday pictures. We
will accept any cool paper on a topic related to the
following:

       - science
       - hacking
       - cryptography
       - security
       - drugs
       - explosives
       - forensics
       - coding
       - conspiracy

This CFP was issued on  Tuesday the 9th of December,
2008. We accept submissions and editorial changes up
until whenever the hell you are done because there's
no other way we get enough articles anyway.

And here comes the usual krap:  You should make sure
that whatever  you submit is somewhat original, best
would be something completely new.  It does not have 
to be OpenSSH remote root 0day, but we do appreciate
some fresh ideas and creative stuff in the zine. 

That said, know that we're polite. You don't have to 
fear any kind of condescending or insulting response
from us, let alone  public humiliation, for anything
you submit.  Alright then, send your papers and dead
babies to
