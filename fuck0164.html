                             You Don't Know Me...
                             --------------------


You don't know me, but I'm lame.

I've cloned a MDT (Mobile Data Terminal) to intercept data transmissions
from patrol cars.  I was IP spoofing in 1989.  I learned to program DMS
switches without a manual.  I hack root on Unix using bugs I've
discovered myself.  I built and used my own Blue Box.  I've hacked
Operating Systems that simply do not exist anymore.  I created a
tumbling mod for my cell phone.  But you don't know me...

Every now and then, I create an account on a random Internet system and
check in on #hack or #phreak.

It is here that we meet.  You are a regular on IRC.  I am an unknown
user with an unknown name and an unknown nick.  I say something.  You
pronounce me lame and kick me off channel because you don't understand
what I'm talking about.  You pronounce me lame and make some statement
about how newbies should stay off of IRC.  You don't recognize my nick
or my username, so I am lame.  But you don't know me.

Sometimes, I like to read alt.2600.  Occasionally, I will post a
message.  Sometimes I fake post my message, other times I post it
anonymously.  Most often, the account I post from simply disappears
minutes later.

My post may have been a simple question, about a system I haven't hacked
before.  My post may have been a response to someone asking a question
to which I know the answer.  My post may simply have been
conversational.  You read my post and decide to flame me.  You've never
seen me before and you can't understand why *I* would be posting *here*.
It's okay to flame me though, because I'm lame.  But you don't know me.

We meet on a conf.  You don't recognize the handle I'm using today.  You
don't recognize my voice.  You say "What is *he* doing here?"  You tell
me how eleet you are and how you know everyone who is anyone in the
world of hacking.  You tell me how lame I am.  But you don't know me.

You don't know me, but I'm lame.
