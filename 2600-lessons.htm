    2600: Linking Rules for &quot;Hacking&quot; and Other Alternative Websites</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><em>By William Reilly</em></p>
    <p>Joe Whitehat operates a web site devoted to exploring network security vulnerabilities
    and other &quot;hacking-related&quot; issues. Joe&#146;s objective is to provide a public
    forum for members of the Internet security field to share their knowledge of exploits and
    vulnerabilities. Joe does not host programs on his server. Rather, he provides links to
    programs of interest to the community. On one of Joe&#146;s pages, he provides a link to a
    program that is able to defeat an access control measure on a new type of digital format.
    The fact that the new access control measure is so easily defeated is a topic of sincere
    interest in the research and network security community because the weakness in the
    algorithm used in this measure may be point to weaknesses in their own access control
    measures. One day, Joe receives a certified letter demanding that he delete the
    hyperlinked reference to the program from his website, or face the consequences of
    &quot;trafficking&quot; in a technology that is for use in &quot;circumventing a
    technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under the
    Copyright Act.&quot; What is Joe supposed to do?</p>
    <p>Joe would argue that he only provides a link to the site, and that he can&#146;t be
    responsible for the illegal acts of others. The copyright owners aren&#146;t charging him
    with copyright infringement, but rather a highly controversial subsection of the DMCA,
    which bans the act of circumventing, the development and trafficking of tools used to
    circumvent, and trafficking in the tools that can infringe on the work after it has been
    circumvented or accessed. Joe would surely try to suggest that he is not
    &quot;trafficking&quot; in the program by making the argument that it is not illegal for a
    newspaper to publish the address of a store that sells obscene material. He, like the
    newspaper, is merely pointing to the address where the illegal contraband may be located.
    Unfortunately for Joe, a New York federal District Court and a Second Circuit Court of
    Appeal has found that under certain circumstances discussed below, the court can force Joe
    to delete the links to the DMCA offending material. </p>
    <p>This article will look at the court&#146;s linking arguments and suggest ways that web
    site owners can avoid falling into the category of being a &quot;trafficker&quot; by
    following the rules set out by the court. It should be stressed that this is only the
    current law in the Second Circuit, which includes the states of Connecticut, New York and
    Vermont. However, other jurisdictions could consider these holdings
    &quot;persuasive,&quot; which means that they don&#146;t have to follow the rules set out
    in the cases, but they can use them if they find the application of the law was
    appropriate. <ol>
      <b>
      <li>What Can you Host on Your Website?:</b></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The first thing to clarify is what you can have on your website, and what you can link
    to. If you are a US-based website, which means either a business or server presence
    located in a US State or territory, then you likely will fall under some US jurisdiction.
    Just because you are a &quot;cyber&quot; company with no tangible assets does not mean
    that you are above US jurisdiction. As the US Attorney has argued in the
    Elcomsoft/Sklyarov DMCA criminal case, you can fall under US personal jurisdiction even if
    you are a Moscow software development company with no assets, personnel, or presence in
    the US. In that case, the Moscow-base company offered software that potentially violated
    the DMCA anti-circumvention provisions on an Internet server based in Chicago and entered
    into a distribution agreement with a Washington state-based online software distributor
    and transaction processor. The US Attorney argued that the act of offering the software on
    the Chicago server, as well as the distribution agreement that allegedly targeted US
    consumers, was enough to bring criminal charges against the Russian firm. They gained
    personal jurisdiction over the company when one of its employees came to the US to speak
    at DefCon. If no one from the company ever stepped foot in the US, they had no assets in
    the US, and the program was legal in Russia, then the US government could not have done
    anything against the Russian company. In order to extradite someone from another country
    to the US, there must be a bilateral treaty where the act was illegal in both countries
    and the crime was committed in the requesting country by the defendant. Since the program
    was arguably legal in Russia, extradition was not an option. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p>The Broad Rules of Thumb:</b></p>
    <p>The first broad rule of thumb is that you should never store on a website any content
    that could subject you to a lawsuit. This goes for ISPs, discussion groups, as well as
    commercial and private web sites. </p>
    <p>Objectionable content can be defamatory, which can lead to civil damages if the person
    can show that there is defamatory language that tends to adversely affects one&#146;s
    reputation, can be shown to be &quot;of and concerning the plaintiff,&quot; is published
    on the Internet by someone who directly was responsible for writing the statement or by a
    secondary person knew or should have known that the statements were defamatory, and that
    there was damage to the plaintiffs reputation as a result. Content can also infringe on
    another&#146;s intellectual property, such as copyright, trademarks and patents. If you
    receive notice that there is infringing material on your site, it is wise to pull it
    immediately and then seek counsel from an attorney. Content can also be criminal if, for
    example, it contains obscene material or malicious code. These are some of the types of
    content that you should not reside on your server if you are a US resident, US company,
    commercially target the US or have a US-based server. </p>
    <p>The second broad rule of thumb in light of the holding in the <i>Universal et al. v.
    Reimbursed et al </i>case, is that you should be very careful when you provide a hyper
    link from you website to another site that might contain any &quot;actionable&quot; or
    legally objectionable content. In <i>Reimerdes</i>, the Motion Picture Association of
    America sought to prohibit Eric Corley from hosting and linking to a program that
    threatened the viability of their DVD access control measures. Corley was a print and
    electronic publisher of the well-known &quot;hacker&quot; magazine <i>2600</i>, which
    provides extensive research, news and other articles on phreaking, hacking, cracking, and
    network security. In November 1999, Corley posted a copy of the decryption program
    &quot;DeCSS&quot; on his 2600.com website and also provided many hyperlinks to other
    server sites that hosted DeCSS. The District Court in New York issued a permanent
    injunction that barred Corley from posting DeCSS on his website or from &quot;knowingly
    linking via a hyperlink to any other website containing DeCSS. Corley sought appellate
    review of the lower court holding, where the Second Circuit Court of the Appeals upheld
    the trial court link injunction. This case is a good case to discuss because Corley lost
    on every point in two federal courts. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p>What Can You Link To and Why:</p>
    <p>1. Never Taunt the Court or the Plaintiff:</b></p>
    <p>In the <i>2600 </i>case, there are three words that seriously impacted their defense
    &#150; &quot;electronic civil disobedience.&quot; The trial court referred to that
    statement three times in the ruling, each time with an increasing distaste for the
    defendant. When the court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Corley from hosting
    the DeCSS program on his site, he encouraged visitors to download the program from other
    servers via hyperlinks on his site as a sign of &quot;electronic civil disobedience.&quot;
    To make matters worse, Corley wrote on the website &quot;We have to face the possibility
    we may be forced into submission. For that reason it&#146;s especially important that as
    many of you as possible, all throughout the world, take a stand and mirror these
    files.&quot; In the plaintiff&#146;s brief, it was also noted that Corley defied &quot;the
    authorities to shut down his site promoting the free copying of DVDs, stating that
    &#145;there is no lawyer that can prevent us,&#146; and announced: &quot;Notice: The DVD
    Copy Control Association are c---suckers!&quot; The court also noted that Corley placed
    the hyper links to the mirrored sites only after he ensured that the other sites were in
    fact the posting DeCSS code. </p>
    <p>The court was not amused. Judge Kaplan wrote that the &quot;defendants obviously hoped
    to frustrate plaintiff&#146;s recourse to the judicial system by making effective relief
    difficult or impossible.&quot; Those are strong words that you don&#146;t want to ever
    have a judge make about your actions. In other words, Judge Kaplan said that by
    encouraging others to download DeCSS on other sites as an act of disobedience, Corley was
    trying to get around the system to harm the plaintiffs. The judge ensured he had the last
    laugh.</p>
    <p>It is important to understand that Corley could have been liable for money damages. The
    MPAA sought damages pursuant to 17 U.S.C. Section 1203(c) and (b), which would have been
    statutory damages of $2,500 per offer of DeCSS! These damages could have been
    &quot;incalculable,&quot; as Judge Kaplan explained. However, because the defendants had
    no assets to speak of, and that the damage amount was too speculative to calculate, the
    court held that there was an inadequate remedy at law and therefore injunctive relief was
    the only available remedy.</p>
    <p>The most obvious lesson to be learned from the above reaction is that you should never
    taunt the court&#146;s ability to comprehend the technology or enforce judgements. Judges
    unofficially use what is called a &quot;smell test&quot; to size up the character and
    motive of the parties in an action. When there are signs that one side is acting in a
    cocky, arrogant, and underhanded sly manner, the courts are not going to be favorably
    predisposed to that party, to say the least. While Corley&#146;s exasperation with the
    situation he found himself in with the MPAA is understandable, in the end it was
    counterproductive because the court saw it as evidence of his intent to violate the DMCA
    and recognition on his part that the program was controversial and legally questionable. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p>2. Write all copy and messages with careful deliberation:</b></p>
    <p>Whenever you are writing copy for a website, you unfortunately always have to consider
    how that text would look in the courtroom as &quot;Exhibit 659.&quot; Also, with much of
    the Internet cached on the Way Back Machine and other archives, not only your present
    words, but all of your past online statements can be used against you. So the words used
    on a web site, even if taken down by you at a later time, could be cached somewhere on the
    Internet. </p>
    <p>Also, prosecutors and lawyers have become savvy at researching newsgroup archives and
    discussion groups for written statements that can be used against you. Whenever you submit
    comments on Slashdot or your favorite newsgroup, you need to think about the consequences
    of the statement. Is it an opinion that, if used in court, could weaken a position about
    actions on your website? Most laws require some form of intent, knowledge or notice, and
    barring some statement made on the witness stand or in a deposition, they need to prove it
    by bringing in other statements or actions to show you intended the consequence of your
    &quot;wrongful&quot; actions. For example, in order to prove that you developed a piece of
    software to duplicate copyrighted music, your argument that there are significant
    non-infringing uses of the program is shot down if there is a newsgroup discussion where
    you brag about how the program is going to bring the music monopoly to its knees. In the
    Napster saga, Judge Patell found that internal e-mails indicated that the Napster founders
    had copyright infringement as the motive for their program. A document authored by
    co-founder Sean Parker mentioned the need to remain ignorant of users' real names and IP
    addresses &quot;since they are exchanging <i>pirated </i>music.&quot; The same document
    stated that, in bargaining with the RIAA, Napster will benefit from the fact that &quot;we
    are not just making <i>pirated </i>music available but also pushing demand.&quot; Judge
    Patell found that &quot;these admissions suggest that facilitating the unauthorized
    exchange of copyrighted music was a central part of Napster, Inc.'s business strategy from
    the inception.&quot; Like diamonds, digital messages are forever.</p>
    <p>By now you should be aware that linking to anything on another site that could get you
    in trouble if it was located on your own site is a dangerous activity. But it doesn&#146;t
    mean that all links to online contraband should be banned. If that were the case, then
    there would be a great &quot;chilling effect&quot; on web-based communication because
    hyperlinks lie at the heart of the web&#146;s interactivity. The courts have been
    concerned that such a blanket ban would be unconstitutional because it would be a form of
    prior restraint, or communication that is prohibited even before it is made. For example,
    the court in <i>2600</i> was concerned that &quot;legitimate&quot; news outlets, like the
    New York Times, would be liable for links on their website that discussed controversial
    subjects. The trial court in <i>2600</i> developed a simple formula to guide courts and
    web site owners through this potential minefield. The Court of Appeals hinted that the <i>2600
    </i>linking formula was even too rigid and that they would be willing to work with a more
    &quot;chilling&quot; formula. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p>3. The <i>2600 </i>Linking Test:</b></p>
    <p>Judge Kaplan developed a simple linking formula to help determine when links to
    &quot;contraband&quot; should be restricted or banned and to limit the potential for a
    chilling effect on &quot;legitimate&quot; links by the media. He required that there
    should be clear and convincing evidence that those responsible for the link:<ol TYPE="A">
      <ol TYPE="A">
        <li>know at the relevant time that the offending material is on the linked-to site</li>
        <li>know that it is circumvention technology that may not lawfully be offered and </li>
        <li>creates or maintains the link for the purpose of disseminating the technology.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;<ol TYPE="A">
      <b>
      <li>know at the relevant time that the offending material is on the linked-to site</li>
      </b><p>The court held that Corley violated each of these elements of the test. First,
      Judge Kaplan held that he was aware at the relevant time that the offending material was
      on the linked-to site because he checked on the DeCSS availability before he placed the
      link from 2600. Obviously, if you provide a link that directly points to the .exe, .tar or
      .zip file, you are aware that the material is on the linked-to site. If it deep links to a
      page that only contains the material, that is also an inference that you were aware that
      the material was located on the site at the relevant time. However, if it points to a home
      page on a web site that has a lot of other content, hopefully legal, then you might be in
      a gray zone where the court will apply the &quot;smell test.&quot; </p>
      <p>The lesson here is to be careful how you link to the other web site. A disclaimer that
      states you have no affiliation, financial or otherwise, with the 3<sup>rd</sup> party
      websites, and that you have not checked the links for the any actual offending material
      might be helpful. However, the courts don&#146;t pay a lot of attention to self-serving
      disclaimers if there is other evidence to the contrary. For example, how much credence do
      you think a court is going to give the KaZaA peer-to-peer file trading program when it
      states in its license agreement that &quot;KaZaA does not condone activities and actions
      that breach the copyright of artists and copyright owners - as a KaZaA user you are bound
      by the KaZaA Terms of Use and laws governing copyright in each country.&quot; I would not
      like to be the defense counsel trying to argue in good faith that KaZaA is totally
      oblivious to any copyright infringement going on because of their software and that those
      who wanted to use the software to infringe have read the license terms and declined from
      using the software for fear of violating the terms of the license. Do they really think
      that people who are willing to infringe on the copyrights of others are going to comply
      with the terms of a license agreement that denies the very infringing function of the
      software itself? </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <b>
      <li>know that it is circumvention technology that may not lawfully be offered </li>
      </b><p>However, it is the second prong of the test that the court just almost ignored.
      Corley argued that he didn&#146;t know that the software was unlawful, but because of the
      statements on the website, that argument was not taken seriously. Amazingly, Judge Kaplan
      satisfied this prong by noting that &quot;[t]hey now know that dissemination of DeCSS
      violates the DMCA.&quot; His own test requires knowledge at the time the offense was
      committed that there be clear and convincing evidence that the defendant &quot;knew&quot;
      that it can not be lawfully offered. When Corley posted the link, there was a huge debate
      about whether the program was illegal because the DMCA&#146;s anti-circumvention
      provisions had not been interpreted by a court. Nevertheless, Judge Kaplan reasoned that
      since they now know it is illegal, that satisfied the element that they also knew it at
      the time they posted it. </p>
      <p>In the Elcomsoft case, it submitted a motion arguing that its program, AEPBR, was legal
      in Russia, provided significant fair uses to legitimate users and that Section 1201(b) was
      Constitutionally vague because it was unclear that their program was illegal. They did not
      market the program as a way to defeat access controls on the Adobe E-book reader. The
      court will decide on the merits of the motion ironically on April Fools Day 2002. </p>
      <p>The lesson here is that there should be no reference on the website that you are aware
      that this specific piece of software is likely to be illegal. Links to cracking software,
      serial number lists, trojan programs and other malicious code should be avoided because
      there is a high inference they are illegal in Europe and the US. But programs in the gray
      zone, like AEPBR and DeCSS, are arguably questionable and the court is going to look for
      admissions by you or the website that recognizes its questionable legal status. </p>
      <b>
      <li>creates or maintains the link for the purpose of disseminating the technology</b></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Finally, the court had an easier time justifying the last prong &#150; that the link
    was created for the purpose of disseminating the technology. Corley stated that was his
    intention on his website. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p>4. Link to Pages that Contains A Lot of Legitimate Content</b></p>
    <p>The court, in a footnote, commented that &quot;deep links to a page containing only
    DeCSS located on a site that contains a broad range of other content, all other things
    being equal, would be more likely to be found to have linked for the purpose of
    disseminating DeCSS.&quot; However, the court seemed to infer that a link to a &quot;home
    page of the linked-to site&quot; would be less likely to be found a dissemination. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p>5. Don&#146;t Advertise the Link as a Way to Get Around a Law:</b></p>
    <p>The court noted that sites &quot;that advertise their links as a means of getting DeCSS
    presumably will be found to have created the links for the purpose of disseminating the
    program.&quot; This was the case on 2600.com, and the court came down hard on Corley as a
    result. Remember that the courts are going to look hard at your motivation for posting
    links or hosting software. The court in <i>2600</i> wanted to draw a line between
    &quot;legitimate&quot; news sources, such as the <i>New York Times</i>, and hacking sites,
    such as <i>2600.</i> The court recognized that legitimate network security boards and web
    sites provide a significant role in promoting scientific dialog, research and development.
    There is nothing wrong with strongly criticizing ideas and laws. That is protected speech.
    However, if that critical speech is combined with links to &quot;illegal&quot; contraband
    as a way to resist the ideas or laws, then the court could view that as an intent to
    traffic in the contraband. But if the site seriously discusses the program and provides a
    link to another &quot;serious&quot; website that contains the program without a deep link
    directly to the program, then the court may view the link in a more speech-protected
    manner. The website should be devoid of all references to supporting hacking, cracking,
    etc&#133; - check the metatags and archived versions of the website!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p>7. &quot;Add Your Own Link&quot; Scripts:</b></p>
    <p>There is code that allow users to automatically submit links to a site without the
    involvement of the website owner. This might place the website in the bulletin board
    status where the court will look at the extent of editorial discretion to see if and when
    the bulletin board operator was on notice of infringing material. If no discretion is
    exerted, then the operator is likely put on notice when he receives a take down notice
    informing him of the offending material. It is wise to pull the content immediately and
    then try to sort out who is wrong. It could be argued that the same applies to links
    automatically submitted and posted on the site without the owner&#146;s involvement or
    awareness. </p>
    <p>However, this is not an advisable approach because the court is likely to see through
    this if it was developed to avoid notice. Website operators do have some responsibility
    for the content of their sites. It would be risky to test the court&#146;s interpretation
    of your intent. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p>8. To &quot;href&quot; or Not to &quot;href=&quot;: </b></p>
    <p>In the two <i>2600 </i>opinions, the court went into extensive discussion about the
    Constitutional protection and status of hyperlinks. Specifically, Corley argued that the
    links are constitutionally protected expression and the court must apply the highest form
    of First Amendment scrutiny. Judge Kaplan noted that a hyperlink contains both speech and
    non-speech elements. A hyperlink &quot;conveys information, the Internet address of the
    linked webpage, and has the functional capacity to bring the content of the linked webpage
    to the user's computer screen.&quot; Judge Kaplan concluded that a hyperlink is content-
    neutral because it is performs a function without regard to the speech component of the
    hyperlink. Basically, if a prohibition is content-neutral, the court applies a less
    rigorous test than it does against restrictions placed on the content of the speech.
    Content neutral means that Congress isn&#146;t trying to restrict speech based on a
    message, but rather time, place or manner of the speech and it applies to all relevant
    messages, regardless of what is said. One way to think about neutral content is whether
    the law treats a sign that is in English the same as a sign written in Swahili. If it bans
    all signs regardless of the message, the court will apply something called the
    O&#146;Brien test. The court will look at the regulation to see if it served a substantial
    governmental interest and the regulation was unrelated to the suppression of free
    expression. In other words, does the restriction on the neutral speech involve a
    substantial government interest and that the purpose of the law is not to restrict certain
    speech. </p>
    <p>Judge Kaplan was looking at the impact of the injunction on the hyperlink ban and
    determined that a hyperlink is functional more than expressive because the point of the
    &quot;href&quot; code that creates the link is meant to provide instructions to the
    browsers and servers to deliver a specific page located on another server. </p>
    <p>Both the trial court and the appellate court made a huge issue that hyperlinks make
    &quot;the materials &#133; available for instantaneous worldwide distribution&quot; and
    that &quot;the linked web site is just one click away.&quot; What would happen if the
    website merely provided the URL without a hyperlink? In reality, the court might find it
    two identical in purpose. But the functionality h as been taken out and perhaps the URL is
    more like protected speech. Some news organizations have already begun to refer to the URL
    without hyperlinks. </p>
    <p>However, the appellate court asked the plaintiffs whether banning the hyperlinks would
    permit the court to issue an injunction prohibiting a newspaper from printing addresses of
    bookstore locations carrying obscene materials. The concluded that there is a distinction
    between the two medias because the police can seize the obscene material before the
    newspaper publishes the address of the bookstore. However, if &quot;obscene materials are
    posted on one web site and other sites post hyperlinks to the first site, the materials
    are available for instantaneous worldwide distribution before any preventive measures can
    be effectively taken.&quot; Following the court&#146;s logic, merely posting the URL
    without the hyperlink tags would still allow near &quot;instantaneous worldwide
    distribution&quot; compared to the bookstore. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p>9. Using a Search Engine to Query 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Websites</p>
    <p></b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are many &quot;hacking&quot; and network security websites that employ search
    engines to locate material on other servers. This might actually trigger a very
    interesting area of the DMCA &#150; the safe harbor exemptions of 512(a) for information
    location tools. The concept here is that the website only provides for users to chose the
    terms they are looking for on 3<sup>rd</sup> party websites that are beyond the control of
    the website. In <i>2600, </i>the court&#146;s hyperlink conclusions were based around the
    website&#146;s knowledge that the offending material is located on the 3<sup>rd</sup>
    party site, that it knows that the material is not lawful and the link was created for the
    purpose of disseminating the technology. However, a search engine that queries another
    site could eliminate the &quot;knowledge&quot; requirements and the purpose of
    dissemination because there is no way that the website could know in advance what the user
    would be looking for on a 3<sup>rd</sup> party site. </p>
    <p>Under the Information Location Tools safe harbor located in 17 USC Sec. 512, a web site
    can be shielded from application of the DMCA. Here is an edited version of the safe
    harbor. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p>Information Location Tools. </b></p>
    <p>A service provider shall not be liable &#133; for infringement of copyright by reason
    of the provider referring or linking users to an online location containing infringing
    material or infringing activity, by using information location tools, including a
    directory, index, reference, pointer, or hypertext link, if the service provider &#150; </p>
    <p>(1) (A) does not have <i>actual knowledge</i> that the material or activity is
    infringing; </p>
    <p>(B) in the absence of such actual knowledge, is <i>not aware of facts</i> or
    circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent; or </p>
    <p>(C) upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove, or
    disable access to, the material; </p>
    <p>(2) does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing
    activity, in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control
    such activity; and </p>
    <p>(3) upon notification of claimed infringement as described in subsection (c)(3),
    responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be
    infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity, except that, for purposes of this
    paragraph, the information described in subsection (c)(3)(A)(iii) shall be identification
    of the reference or link, to material or activity claimed to be infringing, that is to be
    removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to
    permit the service provider to locate that reference or link. </p>
    <p>In other words, if a website provides a search capability to a third party&#146;s
    website and does not have <i>actual</i> knowledge or is not <i>aware</i> of infringing
    material, and does not <i>directly </i>receive a financial benefit, then it can be argued
    that the safe harbor applies, atleast to infringing activity. However, the
    anti-circumvention provisions do not concern the act of &quot;infringement,&quot; but
    rather the act of circumventing and devices used to circumvent. So it is not clear whether
    the argument can be made, that atleast with regard to anti-circumvention, search queries
    to a third party site could be shielded by the Section 512 safe harbor provisions. But
    there is a better argument that searches to <i>infringing</i> material, like MP3s, cracker
    programs, etc&#133; could be shielded. It goes without saying that this has not been
    extensively interpreted by the courts and could involve some risks. One thing appears to
    be certain: if you intend to apply the safe harbor provisions, you must carefully follow
    the &quot;take down&quot; provisions. If you receive a &quot;take down&quot; notice,
    immediately call your lawyer and have him advise you on the appropriate procedures to
    ensure that you are complying with the law. If you don&#146;t effectively comply with the
    take down provisions, you could lose the defense.</p>
    <p>One reason why the courts might be hesitant to attach liability to search engines for
    displaying offensive results is because search engines play such a critical role. With
    billions of webpages to chose from, the Internet would cease to function properly without
    search engines directing users to queried content. It would be unrealistic for Google.com
    to be responsible for search results that turned up links to legally offensive material. </p>
    <p>Likewise, the courts would be hard-pressed to punish &quot;hacking&quot; websites that
    merely provide the ability for users to query selected 3<sup>rd</sup> party websites that
    they have no control over, or receive any direct financial benefit. However, the courts
    seem to dislike rebel defendants hiding behind the larger impact precedents &#150; i.e.,
    that &quot;you must apply the same standard to us as them.&quot; The <i>2600</i> court
    dealt with that issue in the linking of large &quot;respectable&quot; websites like the <i>New
    York Times</i> compared to 2600.com by requiring a that the link be created &quot;for the
    purpose of disseminating the technology.&quot; The <i>New York Times</i> didn&#146;t and
    2600.com did &#150; end of story. The court could apply a similar fuzzy distinction with
    search engines located on &quot;hacking&quot; sites by strengthening the Section 512
    &quot;is <i>not aware of facts</i> or circumstances from which infringing activity is
    apparent&quot; clause. The court would look for evidence that the website operators were
    &quot;aware&quot; of the circumstances in which the 3<sup>rd</sup> party site they offer
    search queries on contain infringing or other offensive material. Once again, the tone and
    overall purpose of the website might become a relevant issue. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p>Conclusion:</b></p>
    <p>For non-US website, first determine whether you can be brought under US jurisdiction.
    Next, try to determine whether the content is illegal in your own jurisdiction. If it is
    illegal, but it is legal in other countries, then do not host the content on your server.
    If you provide a link to the offending content, then you must be very careful about the
    context in which the link is created. If the court can infer in any manner that the link
    was created to disseminate the content and encourage others to disseminate it, then the
    court could come down heavy on you. However, if the context is scientific or serves some
    other legitimate, useful and responsible purpose, then the court might allow the link,
    even though it wouldn&#146;t allow you to host the content on your own server. This has
    not, to my knowledge, been clarified by the courts, so under these circumstances, link at
    your own risk, and if you receive a complaint, pull the link immediately until the status
    of the content is determined. </p>
    <p>It should also be noted that you <i>could</i> be extradited from your country to the US
    if the content is illegal in your country, your acts concerning the content is prohibited,
    there is an extradition treaty with the US that specifically includes these types of
    offenses, and the offense was committed in the US. However, that is a lot of &quot;<i>ifs&quot;</i>.
    Realistically, your own jurisdiction will prosecute you for violating the law in your
    jurisdiction. However, if you visit the US, the authorities have the right to arrest you
    subject to an indictment and hold you in custody as a flight risk. If you live in an EU
    jurisdiction, you could be extradited to another EU country for a criminal violation of
    copyright laws, according to the most recent EU Cybercrime Convention. </p>
    <p>Until the court decides on the Constitutionality of the DMCA, and perhaps maybe the US
    Supreme Court, US websites that contain links to potentially offending content should be
    put on notice that the court can enjoin such links, and cost the website owners a
    significant amount of money in legal fees. All websites that link to obviously illegal
    content, such as passwords, serial numbers, copyrighted software, cracks, trojan software
    with little or no legitimate uses, virii, etc&#133; should expect a visit from the Feds at
    some point in their career. </p>
    <p>The most important thing to keep in mind when developing your website is to honestly
    ask yourself how the website would look as an evidence exhibit in court to a judge? If it
    looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and squawks like a duck, the court is likely to find
    it is a duck, not matter how clever the technical ruses are used.</p>
