<a name="e01">1. What is alt.2600?</a> 
</p> <p>
alt.2600 is a Usenet newsgroup for discussion of material relating to
2600 Magazine, the hacker quarterly.   It is NOT for the Atari 2600
game machine.  <a href="mailto:len@netsys.com">len@netsys.com</a> created the group on Emmanuel
Goldstein's recommendation.  Emmanuel is the editor/publisher of 2600
Magazine. Following the barrage of postings about the Atari machine to
alt.2600, an alt.atari.2600 was created to divert all of the Atari
traffic from alt.2600.  Atari 2600 people are advised to hie over to
rec.games.video.classic.

</p> <p>
2600Hz was a tone that was used by early phone phreaks (or phreakers) in the
80's, and some currently.  If the tone was sent down the line at the proper
time, one could get away with all sorts of fun stuff.

A note from Emmanuel Goldstein:
</p> <pre>	
The Atari 2600 has NOTHING to do with blue boxes or telephones
or the 2600 Hertz tone.  The 2600 Hertz tone was simply the
first step towards exploring the network.  If you were suc-
cessful at getting a toll call to drop, then billing would
stop at that point but there would be billing for the number
already dialed up until the point of seizure.  800 numbers and
long distance information were both free in the past and
records of who called what were either non-existent or very
obscure with regards to these numbers.  This, naturally, made
them more popular than numbers that showed up on a bill, even
if it was only for a minute.  Today, many 800 numbers go over-
seas, which provides a quick and free way into another coun-
try's phone system which may be more open for exploration.

<a name="e03">3. Are there on-line versions of 2600 available?</a>
</p> <p>
No.

<a name="e04">4. I can't find 2600 at any bookstores.  What can I do?</a>
</p> <p>
Subscribe.  Or, let 2600 know via the subscription address that you
think 2600 should be in the bookstore.  Be sure to include the
bookstore's name and address.

<a name="e05">5. Why does 2600 cost more to subscribe to than to buy at a newsstand?</a>
</p> <p>
A note from Emmanuel Goldstein:
</p> <pre>
We've been selling 2600 at the same newsstand price ($4) since
1988 and we hope to keep it at that price for as long as we
can get away with it. At the same time, $21 is about the right
price to cover subscriber costs, including postage and record
keeping, etc. People who subscribe don't have to worry about
finding an issue someplace, they tend to get issues several
weeks before the newsstands get them, and they can take out
free ads in the 2600 Marketplace.

This is not uncommon in the publishing industry.  The NY
Times, for example, costs $156.50 at the newsstands, and
$234.75 delivered to your door.
