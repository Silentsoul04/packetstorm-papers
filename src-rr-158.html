<H1>A Type System for Java Bytecode Subroutines</H1>

<P>
Java is typically compiled into an intermediate language, JVML, that
is interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine.  Because mobile JVML code
is not always trusted, a bytecode verifier enforces static constraints
that prevent various dynamic errors.  Given the importance of the
bytecode verifier for security, its current descriptions are
inadequate.  This paper proposes using typing rules to describe the
bytecode verifier because they are more precise than prose, clearer
than code, and easier to reason about than either.
<P>
JVML has a subroutine construct which is used for the compilation of 
Java's try-finally statement. Subroutines are a major source of
complexity for the bytecode verifier because they are not obviously
last-in/first-out and because they require a kind of polymorphism. 
Focusing on subroutines, we isolate an interesting, small subset of 
JVML. We give typing rules for this subset and prove their correctness. 
Our type system constitutes a sound basis for bytecode verification 
and a rational reconstruction of a delicate part of Sun's bytecode 
verifier.
