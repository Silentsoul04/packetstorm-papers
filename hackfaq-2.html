<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 What are the four steps to hacking?</A>
</H2>

<P>While there is no hard and fast rule to hacking, most system intrusions can
be divided into four steps. Depending on techniques involved, there could be
less or more, but you should get the basic idea.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Learn as much as possible about your target before the attack. The 
techniques involved can be passive to bordering on mini-attacks themselves. 
And plan out your goals. Using your knowledge gained develop a plan, no matter
how small or quick the hack is.</LI>
<LI> Initial access to the system. No doubt about it, this is the real attack
part. This could be anything from ftp access to a sendmail bug to logging in 
as a "regular" user. It should either create an opportunity for indirect or 
direct access.</LI>
<LI> Full system access. At this level most goals developed can be carried 
out -- password file retrieved for cracking, trojan installed, secret file
copied, etc. So this stage usually involves either taking advantage of a bug
that allows higher priviledges to be obtained, taking advantages of misconfigured
system parameters, or a combination of both.</LI>
<LI> Tracks are covered and backdoors installed. System logging is doctored
to remove traces of the attack and what was done during the attack, and either
defenses are lowered or files are tampered with to allow quicker and easier
access. Some experienced hackers even patch the system to keep less experienced
hackers out of the system (who might possibly tip off a Sys Admin through 
clumsiness). Once step four is complete, hackers will refer to this system
being owned.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Of course some steps might be repeated, especially step two. Or maybe an entire
series of mini "1 2 3 4" "1 2 3 4" attacks are used in concert to obtain access
to a system or achieve a goal.
