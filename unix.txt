 This Reference Guide is Great For
  *All Unix Users 
  *Anybody Participating in a "Hacker Wargame"
  *A Windows user Thinking About Converting to a UNIX-Based
   OS
 We Hope This Guide Serves You Well and We Wish You Luck!

 If your wondering:
  Yes I use linux and you can use ICQ with out windows.
  If you search for ICQ Clones you should be able to find one.
------------------------------------------------------------
 MISC:
 Things you should know.
------------------------------------------------------------
 UNIX is case sensitive
  Which means a file named CAT.txt and another named cat.txt
  ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EVEN IF IN THE SAME DIRECTORY!!
 
 UNIX is not for people new to computers!
  If you are new computers I suggest using windows!
  Try "Hacker Wargames" after a few years of studying computers.
  It is legal to hack in hacker wargames, They are good for learning
  UNIX because you use the same commands you use in UNIX because
  Hacker Wargames are run on UNIX-Based computers. This is good even
  if you aren't interested in hacking.
 
 How to get enter a wargame
  Open your terminal emulator(if using windows type this in MS-DOS
  PROMPT)
  then you type
           telnet <hostnameorip>
  I will list some of the wargames I use at the end of this
  guide.
 
 How to make a file/directory invisible
  just put a period in front.
    !EXAMPLE!
    Say I have a file named stuff.txt.
    I would simply rename it to .stuff.txt
 
 What UNIX-Based OS you should use
  Linux It is great for home and work computers!
  I suggest Linux-Mandrake 7.0 or Corel Linux.
  Linux is a lot cheaper than Windows you can download
  Linux for free if you'd like, we won't dwell into this
  much. The price of a linux CD ranges between 15-49 dollars.

 Where to download Linux(Completely Free)
  I suggest buying linux but if you must download it you can.
  From any linux company site it is illegal for company's selling
  linux CD's to not have their distribution for download and source
  codes as well because it is an open source OS.
  The best place to find almost all dist's is http://www.linux.org

 Problems with using UNIX
  *It is extremely hard to get on the internet
  *It is extremely complicated at times
  *If some lame shit finds out a username and pass you could
   be in a world of trouble(f they are undetected)
  *Partitioning your hard drive
 
 Why use a UNIX-Based OS
  *Good for servers 
  *Great for networking
  *You will learn a lot about computers
  *Hacker Friendly
  
------------------------------------------------------------
 COMMANDS:
 This is not a complete list, It's not even close.
 These commands are enough to use UNIX don't worry you will 
 learn more on your own.
 You can also learn a lot of commands by checking out the bash history
 in a wargame just type
 cat .bash_history

 ALL THE COMMANDS ARE FROM THE BASH SHELL!!!!!!!!
------------------------------------------------------------
 UNTAR
  tar xf <filename>
 Connect to a Remote Computer
  telnet <hostname.or.ip> <port#>
 Finger
  finger <hostname>
 Kill a Program/User
  ps -u <username>
   You will find out all the pid numbers then you type
  kill <pid#>
   To kill everything type
  kill all
 Broadcast Messages
  echo "<message>" | wall
   if you wrote your message to a file type 
  wall <filename>
 Get Help
  help
   or
  ?
 Manuals
  man <manual#>
 List File/Directory's in the directory your currently in
  dir
   or
  l                                          
 Run A File
  cat <filename>
 Change Directories
  cd <directory>
 Find out if something is a directory or file
  <name>
 Login as a different user without closing the connection
  su <username>
 Ping
  ping <hostname.or.ip> 

------------------------------------------------------------
 PROGRAMS:
 To use any of these programs just type the name of the program.
 I probably missed a lot but I'm only familiar with these ones.
 There are many text games but we wont concern ourselves with 
 them.
------------------------------------------------------------
 IRC         Text/E-Mail     Text-Browser
  BitchX      pico            lynx
               pine
                emacs
                  elm
                   mutt

------------------------------------------------------------
 SHELLS:
 Here is all the shells, but just use fucking BASH or KSH.
------------------------------------------------------------
 [Taken From Maximum Linux Magazine (LINUX LOWDOWN: SHELLS VOL.1 NO.3)]

 ASH 
 /bin/ash
  The Almquist Shell, or ash shell was developed in 1989 by
  Kenneth Almquist. It is a Bourne-compatible shell with many
  similarities as the bash shell but it is said to lack the power
  and functionality of the bash shell. Because of its lack of
  power and functionality, it works best with low-end machines.

 BASH
 /bin/bash
  The Bourne shell, or Bash shell is saud to be the "original 
  shell." Its popularity abounds because it uses a command
  syntax similar to that of earlier UNIX systems. It is very
  portable across UNIX platforms, and its lack of complexity
  makes scripting easier for most administrators. The default
  prompt for the Bourne shell is "$."

 CSH
 /bin/csh
  The C shell, or csh shell, is widely used by C programmers
  because of its familiar syntax. The enhanced C shell, known
  as tcsh, has become popular because it allows you to
  "recall" the last commands that you type. Too cool, huh?
  So is the prompt a little different? Yep, as a matter of fact,
  ther default prompt for the C shell is "%."

 KSH
 /bin/ksh
  The Korn shell, or ksh shell as it's known in some circles,
  has the best of the csh and Bash shells, and some additional
  features. Now, let us fill ya in on a little gossip. You're
  going to hear every diehard Linux nut out there in the free
  world talk about the ksh shell and how it's a hacker's shell.
  In all honesty, that's kinda true; Code hackers really do like
  this shell. In fact they really dig it. Why? Because it
  contains the fuctionality of other scripting languages and
  allows, you guessed it, better "coding functionality" than
  other shells. Programs written in ksh are said to run faster,
  however, this remains a religious debate among Linux
  gurus everywhere. We here at Maximum Linux don't really
  care. We just want a shell that gets us where
  we need to go. That's how we like it; simple and sexy!

 RSH
 /bin/rsh
  The Remote shell, or rsh shell, is primarily used to execute
  commands remotley on another UNIX or Linux server. The
  usage of rsh is quite simple. You can execute it with the
  username that it will run as, followed by the hostname of
  the machine you are connecting to, as well as the command.
  If you execute rsh without any directives, it will login
  to the machine specified using rlogin. 

 TCSH
 /bin/tcsh 
  The tcsh shell is one of the most configuritable and functional
  shells to date. It is based on the C shell (wich
  Suzie sells down by the seashore0, wich was originally
  written by William Joy in the early 1980's. The tcsh shell is
  an enhanced C shell. It acts as a command interpreter that
  is used as a login a login shell and a shell script command
  processer. The coolest thing about this shell is that it
  includes a command-line editor, spelling corection, a history
  mechanism, job control, and a syntax relative to the csh shell.  

 ZSH
 /bin/zsh
  A shell that is compatible with ksh, csh and ssh.


 SSH
 /usr/local/bin/ssh
  Of course we can't leave out the coolest and, in the
  past few years, the most needed shell on earth, the secure
  shell, or ssh shell. If you haven't heard about ssh, then you
  have a serious security problem. Secure shell allows you to
  access a machine in an encrypted state That's right,
  Johnny. You don't have to worry about Mrs. Anderson
  peeping over your shoulder during Computer Lab in order
  to catch you telneted into your Linux box in search of X-rated
  images. No, my lad you can now use ssh and
  secretley access all your porno with out fear of getting
  caught. Oh, but watch out for Grandma. She's probably
  sifting through your logs as we speak. That's not good,
  Check out ssh by pointing you favourite neighborhood 
  browser to http://www.ssh.org

 To change your shell, you can usally use the 'chsh' or
 'passwd -e' commands, or you can edit the /etc/passwd file.
 Persue the man pages for more information!


------------------------------------------------------------
 WARGAMES:
 Here are some of the wargames I was talking about earlier.
 The idea of wargames is to learn and try to gain root.
 These might not be around when you read this so search for
 hacker wargames if they aren't available.
 You can add/download files from a wargame easily by FTPing
 to it.
 I suggest using HACK3R.COM's wargames, They are really helpful there.

 You May want to inform your ISP that you will be participating
 in a wargame to further your education in computer security and
 UNIX.

 Joe:Walter I'm Real Bored.
 Walter: Me to, I got an idea!
 Joe:What is this idea?
 Walter:For a day i go one way you go the other and we'll

 Joe:So walter what did you do?
 Walter:I went hiking it was fantastic! I saw tall mountains
        then i swam in this beautiful crystal clear lake. What
        Did you do?
 Joe:I went walking on some traintracks and saw this beautiful
     young woman tied to the tracks, I untied her and gentiley
     lifted her off the tracks. We had sex; every position every
     style all afternoon. It was great!
 Walter:Wow! Your day was much better than mine. So did you end up
        getting a BJ to?
 Joe:No i could'nt find her head!
 
 ~*AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHHAAHHAHAHHA*~

 So what did we learn today?
  *Some stuff about UNIX and Linux and a new joke!

 We really could use a domain name
 like www.wwahp.net or somethin also old ass
 computer shit.
 contact me if you can hook us up with anything.

 That's it for now kiddies!
 Peace!

 P.S.
 Did I actually type that much!??!?!
