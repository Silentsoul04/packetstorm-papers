Symb/Cabir-B is a worm written specifically for Nokia Series 60 mobile phones
running the Symbian operating system.

The worm spreads as a Symbian SIS package named camtimer.sis. The package
contains the following components extracted to ./System/Apps, ./System/CARIBESECURITYMANAGER
and ./System/Recogs:

./system/apps/CamTimer/camtimer.rsc
./system/apps/CamTimer/camtimer.app
./system/apps/caribe/flo.mdl
./system/apps/caribe/caribe.rsc
./system/apps/caribe/caribe.app
./system/CARIBESECURITYMANAGER/caribe.rsc
./system/CARIBESECURITYMANAGER/caribe.app
./system/CARIBESECURITYMANAGER/CAMTIMER.sis
./system/RECOGS/flo.mdl

Flo.mdl is a DLL that uses the EZBoot mechanism to attempt to launch the Symb/Cabir-B
appliction file caribe.app when the device is powered on.

Camtimer.rsc and camtimer.app are parts of a non-malicious camera timer application
installed with the worm.

Once running Symb/Cabir-B attempts to send itself to bluetooth-enabled devices found
in the proximity of the infected mobile phone.

The Symb/Cabir-B camtimer.sis file may be installed by Troj/Skulls-B.
