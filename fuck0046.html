                              Being Elite in '93
                              ------------------


  "Many people believe that 'Elite' Died in the 80's. I think that it has just
progressed. Elite are no longer scum. They are mearly BBSers that follow
unspoken Rules. They have different standards then the run of the mill BBSer.
The Following is a list of things that the 'elite' follow, without being told
to do so."                              -AW

   unless they don't really know how to spell it.

3. The Elite Never Personally Assult someone unless it is warranted, and will
   not slam someone just because others are.

4. The Elite Do not call all the boards in a Area Code, and the boards they
   are on they call at least once every few days to check mail, etc.

5. The Elite are willing to leave their house to meet people, and be social. 

6. The Elite have lives beyond BBSs.

7. The Elite never blow off validation by being an asshole, and assuming they
   will be validated because of their handle. 

8. The Elite never take an argument from one board and carry it over to
   another. 

9. The Elite don't slam things that they don't have all the available 
   information they can get on the topic, and they will back up any 
   claim they do make. 

10. The Elite Don't Push their beliefs on others. 

11. The Elite never judge a person, by one comment.

    interuption of current conversation.

"My definition of elite is someone who knows what they are doing on the 
 boards.  Not much else.  If you know the software, you know the posting
 etiquette, and you know the files, and you know the users, then you are
 elite."                                -Dam

"Yeah some folks might get mad or pissed with it, but that is only because 
 the file might totally shatter their whole entire image of themselves 
 and their little clan."                -Zen
