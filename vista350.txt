Vista 350 is one of the new phones out in Canada. This is not an ordinary 
phone, this phone has many unique features, some are listed below.

-	8 line Display Screen
-	Display Keys
-	Function Keys
-	Call Waiting Display
-	Call Waiting Select
-	ADSI
-	ACMS 

Well a lot of the new phones have some of these features but the features
which are new that I will be talking about are ADSI and ACMS. The Vista 350
is ADSI-compatible, which means it is capable of offering a wide variety of
services such as home banking, travel information lines, and community
bulletin boards.

ADSI...

ADSI stands for Analog Display Services Interface. ADSI is a protocol.
The ADSI protocol is backward compatible with the transmission of caller
identification and related display data from a Stored Program Controlled
System to an off-hook phone. The ADSI Protocol allows voice and data
information to be transmitted to a telephone using existing telephone
lines. It provides a two-way exchange of information. An example of an
ADSI service is Call Waiting Select.

The Vista has ADSI and contains a screen on your telephone that lets you
see your voice mail selections, among other things. You can also send e-mail
messages through your telephone, using the built-in screen and keyboard.
(Vista 350 does not have a keyboard but the new Vistas do.) And you can
complete banking transactions all done through your home telephone. A vision
of the future? Not at all.

The ADSI protocol was developed for the use of Calling Identity Delivery on
Call Waiting. In Calling Identity Delivery on Call Waiting, an audible
alerting tone generated by the network "wakes up" the telephone, prepares it
to receive data, and instructs it to mute the voice path. The Caller ID data
message is then sent via Frequency Shift Keying and displayed on the screen.
ADSI substantially expands this protocol structure by defining a complex
syntax, a set of messages, and rules for both the phone and servers to
follow when using the interface. 

ADSI permits the transmission of either voice or data, with a very short
train-up period required to begin data transmission or "downloading," and by
defining a set of ADSI-resident script components. The phone (Vista 350)
receives data via Frequency Shift Keying and responds via Dual Tone Multi-
Frequency (DTMF) tones. The ADSI further expands the Calling Identity
Delivery on Call Waiting concept by identifying two types of network-to-the-
phone communications that can be downloaded to the phone from a server and
run independently by the phone.

The first type of ADSI network-to-the-phone communications is known as
Server Display Control (SDC). Server Display Control provides temporary
downloading for the current transaction, or SDC Session. The server sends
messages through the analog Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) which
provides instructions for the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) on how to
display information and user interface control mechanisms. The Vista
transmits user input for the session by transmitting DTMF tones to
interactively provide the user's response to the feature.

               This is an 
         interactive connection

         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                ~=DTMF

The second type of network-to-the-phone communications is known as Feature
Download Management (FDM). FDM provides semi-permanent downloading of a
resident script server into the Vista. A Vista resident feature script
executes on the phone itself to display information to the customer and to
react to the customer's responses. The script provides the functional logic
of the features it supports, as well as instructions on how to display
information and user interface control mechanisms, such as dynamic soft
keys.
	
               This is scripts being
         downloaded from server (ads, etc.)

ACMS...

ACMS is an Advanced Call Management Server. The ACMS server runs on a
Windows NT box.

There are two types of ADSI network services, those which are provided by
the switch (i.e. Call Waiting Select), and those that come from scripts
stored on an Advanced Call Management Server.

Scripts make features easier to use by adding visual displays and audio
prompts. ACMS scripts have several advantages. There are soft keys that are
used instead of remembering codes, reminders of available options, and
context sensitive options... meaning you can only see the options that work
in your situation.

Downloading scripts from the ACMS takes a few seconds. This is done
after installation of the vista 350, it downloads the features you have
access to and your personal features like home banking, etc.

If you get a hold of an ACMS/ADSI server you can do a lot and can program
your own scripts. <evil grin> This might be useful for those ADSI Home
Banking servers that ask you for a card number and pin number, now you can
program it to brute force it. Or another idea is to make a script for
wardialing and saving it to a file in the phone. Or you can have games.
There are many possibilities.



--------------- Edmonton, Alberta Vista 350 Server Numbers -----------------

Well here is a list I scanned by hand. The reason why I scanned by hand is
because if you use a wardialer it would not pick up the ADSI tone. I will be
working on a program that will pick up ADSI tones if possible. Most of these
phone numbers belong to Call Mall and there is a lot of them. If you know of
any 800 numbers to ADSI servers and/or a local phone number I missed, let me
know so I can add it in.
