	Generally refers to <B>strong</B> (unbreakable) encryption. Web-browsers contain an option
	for <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#40-bit">40-bit</A> vs. 128-bit encryption. The United States
	only allows export of the weaker version in order to allow the government
	to spy on foreigners, especially during times of war (Author's note: my grandfather
	worked with the codebreakers in WWII -- it had
	a major impact indeed on winning the war). However, the U.S. export restrictions
	can easily be easily be bypassed, allowing many foreigners access to products
	with 128-bit encryption (example: <A HREF="https://www.ccc.de/" CLASS="external">https://www.ccc.de</A>).
	Likewise, it has stiffled developement within the United States of products
	that need encryption, such as IEEE 802.11 wireless Ethernet.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> The debate over strong encryption is never ending. Within the United
	States, law enforcement is constantly lobbying to restrict the use of strong encryption.
	Many resist, pointing out how often law enforcement already abuses wiretap powers
	(such as against Martin Luther King). At the same time, companies making products
	constantly lobby for the easing of export restrictions, so that they can sell
	strong encryption products abroad. Another funny thing is that the U.S. government's
	intransigence on this issue has actually led to stronger encryption abroad.
	U.S. export restrictions (and desire to spy on foreigners) was one of the reasons
	France relaxed its own law-enforcement bans on encryption use by citizens. 
	

<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="40-bit">40-bit</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[1]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	The term "40-<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#bit">bit</A> encryption" refers to the U.S. encryption export laws
	(note: in January, 2000, the U.S. upped the maximum size to <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#64-bits">64-bits</A>. The U.S. restricts
	the export of "strong encryption" technology. Products that include 40-bit encryption
	or less can freely be exported. Therefore, products like web browsers, wireless communications,
	DVD keys, etc. all use 40-bit encryption.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> Specialized hardware can decrypt 40-bit keys in real time. The average new desktop
	has enough horsepower to decrypt 40-bit messages. Thus, many people now consider 40-bit encryption
	to be simply <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#obscure">obfuscated</A> <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#plaintext">plaintext</A>.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> 40-bit often refers to the <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#rc4">RC4</A> system
	within <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#browser">browsers</A>.

<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="56-bit">56-bit</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[1]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	56-bit encryption contains 16-more bits than <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#40-bit">40-bit</A> encryption, and is therefore 65536 times
	more difficult to <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#crack">crack</A>. On the other hand, it is likewise 256 times
	easier to crack than than 64-bit encryption.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> In January of 1999, the <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/" CLASS="external">EFF</A>
	built a custom 
	machine (the "<A HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/Privacy/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/" CLASS="external">Deep Crack</A>") for $250,000 that could decrypt 56-bit DES encrypted messages
	in hours.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> 56-bit cryptography almost always refers to <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#des">DES</A>.
	
<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="64-bit">64-bit</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[1]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	In January of 2000, the U.S. government eased its export regulations

	<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#40-bit">40-bit</A> to <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#64-bit">64-bit</A> <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#key">keys</A>.
	Presumably, the government would only do so if the <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#nsa">NSA</A>
	had the capability of decrypting 64-bit encrypted messages. It is interesting
	to note that <A HREF="http://www.distributed.net/">distributed.net</A>'s
	RC5-64 challenge cracking team of 100,000 computers working for about 2.5 years
	had managed only to check about 18% of the keyspace. This implies
	that the NSA has extremely hefty software.


<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="8-character-password">8-character password</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[4]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	Some systems, like Win9x and Solaris, limit the user to 8 characters in the password.
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> Security conscious users of such systems need to make sure
	they use a more random mix of characters because they cannot create long passwords.
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> Password <A HREF"#CRACK">cracking</A> such systems is a little easier.


<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="tildauser">~user</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[3]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	On UNIX, a home directory can be referenced by using
	a tilda (~) followed by their login name. For example,
	"<TT>ls ~rob</TT>" on my computer will list all the files
	in "<TT>/home/rob</TT>".

	<P><B>Key point:</B> Web-servers often allow access to user's directories
	this way. An example would be <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/~rob">http://www.robertgraham.com/~rob</A>.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> A big hole on the Internet is that people unexpectedly
	open up information. For example, the file <TT>.bash_history</TT> is
	a hidden file in a person's directory that contains the complete
	text of all commands they've entered into the <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#shell">shell</A>
	(assuming their shell is "bash", which is the most popular one
	on Linux).

<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="dev-null">/dev/null</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[1]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	On UNIX, this is a virtual-file that can be written to. Data written
	to this file gets discarded. It is similar to the file call <TT>NUL</TT>
	on Windows machines.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> When <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#root">rooting</A> a machine,
		hackers will often redirect logging to <TT>/dev/null</TT>
		For example, the command
		<NOBR><TT CLASS="example">ln -s /dev/null .bash_history</TT></NOBR>
		will cause the system to stop logging <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#bash">bash</A>
		commands.

	<P><B>Culture:</B> In the vernacular, means much the same thing
		as "black hole". Typical usage, "if you don't like what I have to
		say, please direct your comments to /dev/null".

<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="etc">/etc</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[1]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	The directory on UNIX where the majority of the configuration
	information is kept. It is roughly analogous to the 
	Windows <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#registry">registry</A>.
	Of particular interest is <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#etc-passwd"><TT>/etc/passwd</TT></A> file
	that stores all the passwords.
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> If a hacker can read files from this directory, then they
	can likely use the information to attack the machine.

<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="etc-passwd">/etc/passwd</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[1]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	The UNIX file that contains the account information, such as username,
	<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#password">password</A>, login directory, and default <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#shell">shell</A>.
	All normal users on the system can read this file.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> The passwords are encrypted, so even though everyone
	can read the file, it doesn't automatically guarantee access to the system. However,
	programs like <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#crack">crack</A> are very effective
	at decrypting the passwords. On any system with many accounts,
	there is a good chance the hacker will be able to crack some of the accounts
	if they get hold of this file.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> Modern UNIX systems allow for "shadowed" password files,
	stored in locations like <TT>/etc/shadow</TT> that only <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#root"><TT>root</TT></A>
	root has access to. The normal password file still exists, minus the password
	information. This provides backwards compatibility for programs that
	still must access the password file for account information, but
	which have no interest in the passwords themselves.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> The chief goal of most hacks against UNIX systems
	is to retrieve the password file. Many attacks do not compromise the
	machine directly, but are able to read files from the machine, such
	as this file. Typical examples include:
	<DL COMPACT>
	<DT><A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#tftp">TFTP</A><DD>Typical exploit asks for the 
		filename "<TT>/etc/passwd</TT>". Some systems are misconfigured
		so that this works.
	<DT><A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#ftp">FTP</A><DD>Similar to TFTP above, simply
		asking for the file can get it. 
		<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#directory-traversal">Directory traversal</A> sometimes works.
		Sometimes a <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#shell">shell</A> can be exploited to reveal the file.
	<DT><A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#http">HTTP</A><DD>Many custom web-servers (such as built-in
		ones used for remote management) contain 
		<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#directory-traversal">directory traversal</A>
		bugs that can be used to retrieve the file. Example:
		<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/etc/passwd" CLASS="external">http://www.robertgraham.com/../../../etc/passwd</A>.
	<DT><A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#cgi-bin"><TT>/cgi-bin</TT></A><DD>
		A huge number of CGI scripts contain bugs that can be exploited to

		<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#directory-traversal">directory traversal</A> vulnerabilities,
		<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#shell">shell</A> vulnerabilities, as well as other

<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="access-control">Access Control List</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[3]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">

	Controlling access not only the system in general, but also resources within the system.
	For example, <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#firewall">firewalls</A> can be configured to allow access to different portions
	of the network for different users. Likewise, even after you log onto
	a file server, the server may still block access to certain files.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> An <B>Access Control List (ACL)</B> is used to list
		those accounts that have access to the resource that the list applies
		to. When talking about <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#firewall">firewalls</A>, the ACL
		implies the list of IP addresses that have access to which ports and systems through the <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#firewall">firewall</A>.
		When talking about <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#winnt">WinNT</A>, the ACL

	<P><B>Contrast:</B> <B>Discretionary Access Control</B> is the ability to have

<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="algorithm">algorithm</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[1]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	A series of steps specifying which actions to take in which order. This general
	term in the security field generally refers to an <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#encryption">encryption</A>
	or <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#hash">algorithm</A>.
	
	<P><B>Analogy:</B> An cookbook recipe is an algorithm. 
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> Different algorithms have different
	levels of complexity. For example, consider the ancient
	parable (Babylonian?) about a king and a wise subject who
	did a favor for him. The subject asked for one piece of grain
	to be placed on the first square of a chess board, two grains
	on the second, four grains on the third, and so on, doubling
	the amount of grain for each successive square.
	<P>
	This problem demonstrates an algorithm of exponential complexity.
	For the first 10 squares of the chess board, the series is:
	1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512. Thus, for the first 10 squares, roughly
	a thousand grains must be paid out. However, the series continues (using K=1024):
	1k 2k 4k 8k 32k 64k 128k 256k 512k. Thus, for the first 20 squares, roughly
	a million grains must be paid out. After 30 squares, roughly a billion
	grains must be paid out. For 40 squares, roughly a trillion grains must be
	paid out.
	<P>
	This is directly related to such things as <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#key">key size</A>.
	A 41-bit key is twice as hard to crack as a 40-bit key. A 50-bit
	key is a thousand times harder. A 60-bit key is a million times harder.
	This is why the 128-bit vs. 40-bit encryption debate is so important:
	128-bit keys are a trillion trillion times harder to crack (via
	<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#brute-force">brute force</A>) than 40-bit keys.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> Most algorithms are public, meaning that somebody
	trying to decrypt your message knows all the details of the algorithm.
	Consequently, the message is protected solely by the <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#key">key</A>.
	Many people try to add additional protection by making the details of
	the algorithm secret as well. Experience so far has led to the belief
	that this actually leads to weaker security for two reasons. First, 
	such secrets always get discovered eventually, so if security depends upon
	this secret, it will eventually be broken. Secondly, human <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#iq">intelligence</A>
	is such that someone cannot create a secure algorithm on his/her own. Therefore,
	only by working with a community of experts over many years can humans create
	a secure algorithm. To date, only two such communities exist: the entire world
	of cryptography experts publishing the details of their work and trying to break
	other people's work, and the tightly knit community of cryptography experts
	working in secret for the <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#nsa">NSA</A>.

	Anonymity is one of the "holy grails" of hacking. 

	<P><B>Key point:</B> Anonymous e-mail services like Hotmail put the IP address of
	the person sending the e-mail in the headers (which are normally hidden from view
	by e-mail clients). Many would-be hackers get caught this way.

	The server-side scripting language for Microsoft <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#iis">IIS</A>
	web server.
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> A recurring bug in ASP has allowed hackers to read the
	script rather than the output of the script. These techniques rely upon
	changing the name of the script such that the server not longer recognizes
	it as a script, but as a file instead. Some techniques that have worked
	in the past have been:
	<DL>
	<DT>/default.asp.<DD>
		The file system automatically strips trailing dots because of the
		way Windows hides/appends file extensions.
	<DT>/default.asp%2E<DD>
		Same bug as above. Microsoft released a patch whereby the webserver
		checks for the appended dot. However, <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#url-encode">url-encoding</A>
		the dot bypasses this quick fix.

<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="arp">ARP</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[3]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	ARP is a <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#protocol">protocol</A> used with TCP/IP to resolve addresses.
	The TCP/IP stack used to transmit data across the Internet is independent
	from the Ethernet used to shuttle data between local machines. Thus, when
	when machine needs to send an <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#ip">IP</A> packet to a nearby machine,
	it broadcasts the IP address on the local Ethernet asking for the corresponding
	Ethernet address. The machine who owns the address responds, at which point
	the IP packet in question is sent to that Ethernet address.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> By sniffing ARP packets off the wire, you can discover
	a lot of stuff going on. This is especially true of cable-modem and DSL
	segments. Since ARP packets are broadcasts, you aren't technically 
	breaking your user's agreement by sniffing.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> You can spoof ARP requests and/or responses in order

	<P><B>Key point:</B> 
	Back doors are frequently programmed into systems either benignly or

	On the Internet, BGP is used between ISPs in order to communicate routers.
	For example, imagine that the ALICE ISP needs to reach the BOB ISP. However,
	ALICE is not directly connected to BOB. ALICE therefore must figure out
	which ISP should be used to send traffic to BOB. It is through the use of
	BGP that such information is discovered. The name "border" comes from the
	fact that ISPs use BGP only on their borders (in contrast, they
	would use some other protocol (like <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#ospf">OSPF</A>) inside

	<P><B>Key point:</B> BGP can be subverted in numerous ways. BGP is generally

<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="bios">BIOS</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[3]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	On your PC, the <I>BIOS</I> is the software the first runs when
	your computer starts up. All the messages you see when it starts up
	are from the BIOS program. Once it gets through testing memory
	and configuring your system, it then "boots" the operating
	system that you've installed on your hard-disk.

	<P><B>Key pont:</B> The BIOS stores configuration settings in
	<A NAME="nvram">NVRAM</A> (Non-Volatile RAM). Remember that the
	contents of your normal RAM/memory are lost when you power-off your
	computer. The contents of NVRAM, in contrast, are retained when
	power goes off. Most NVRAM consists of CMOS (low-power) chips
	with a small battery that constantly feeds power to the chips (such
	batteries last about 5-years). A common trick of hackers and viruses
	is to corrupt the CMOS settings causing the computer to fail to
	boot. Removing the battery connection (usually a jumper on the motherboard)
	will cause the CMOS settings to be lost and be reset back to default
	(good) state.

	<P><B>Key pont:</B> All of today's BIOSes are stored in programmable ROMs,
	which allows them to be reprogrammed (usually with bug fixes from the manufacturer).
	This allows the hacker to reprogram them as well. While in theory the
	hacker could reprogram his/her own code into the BIOS, in practice this
	has not been done yet. Instead, hackers can sometimes use this programming
	feature to corrupt the BIOS code (in much the same way they corrupt
	the BIOS settings mentioned above). This will usually prevent the system
	from booting even to a point where a fresh BIOS can be re-programmed into
	the system. This requires that the system be brought back to the vendor
	in order to have the BIOS reprogrammed. Note that you can often set
	a jumper on the motherboard that denies the ability to reprogram the

	This relative ancient protocol facilitates booting devices ("clients") from a network

	In this configuration, the bootp protocol configures the diskless device with

	At this point, the client shifts to <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#tftp">TFTP</A> to download

	<P><B>Key point:</B> <A NAME="#dhcp">DHCP</A> is simply an extension

	<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#password">password</A>.
	
	<P><B>Analogy:</B> If you somehow steal somebody's ATM card, you
	could try to use it in a bank machine. PIN numbers are only 4 digits,
	meaning 10,000 possible combinations. If you were patient, you
	could stand at the cash machine trying all possible 10,000
	combinations. (Of course, ATM machines will always eat the
	cards after a few unsuccessful tries in order to stop this).
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> The term <I>brute force</I> often means "the most difficult way".
	In the above example of the PIN number, you can always find
	the PIN number after guessing 10,000 combinations. But sometimes
	there are easier ways. For example, a bank may choose to 
	assign PIN numbers based upon a combination of the issuing
	date and the user's name. Therefore, the problem is reduced
	to guessing when a card was issued, which may consist of
	only a few hundred guesses.
	<P>
	Therefore, any technique that is more difficult than brute force
	is pointless. Likewise, brute force is very difficult, so
	hackers continually search for techniques that are less difficult.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> The possibility of doing brute-force key-space
	searches is often compared to the age of the universe, number of atoms
	in the planet earth, and the yearly output of the sun. For example,
	<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#bruce-schneier">Bruce Schneier</A> has calculated that according
	to what we know of quantum mechanics today, that the entire energy

<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="buffer-overflow">buffer overflow</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[2]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	A classic hack that sends more data than a program expects.
	
	<P><B>Analogy:</B> Consider two popular bathroom sink designs. One design
	is a simple sink with a single drain. The other design includes a backup
	drain near the top of the sink. The first design is easy and often looks better,
	but suffers from the problem that if the drain is plugged and the water
	is left running, the sink will overflow all over the bathroom. The second
	design prevents the sink from overflowing, as the water level can never
	get past the top drain.
	
	<P><P><B>Example:</B> In much the same way, programmers often forget to validate input.
	They (rightly) believe that a legal username is less than 32 characters long,
	and (wrongly) reserve "more than enough" memory for it, typically
	200 characters. However, they frequently forget to check if some
	malicious hacker enters an illegal username 1000 characters long.
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> This is a classic programming bug that afflicts almost
	all systems. The average system on the Internet is vulnerable
	to a well known buffer overflow attack. Many Windows NT
	servers have IIS services vulnerable to a buffer overflow in ".htr" handler,
	many Solaris servers have vulnerable
	RPC services like <TT>cmsd</TT>, ToolTalk, and <TT>statd</TT>; many

	or <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#ftp">FTP</A> services.
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> Programs written in C are most vulnerable, C++
	is somewhat less vulnerable. Programs written in scripting level
	languages like VisualBasic and Java are generally not vulnerable.
	The reason is that C requires the programmer to check buffer
	lengths, but scripting languages generally make these checks
	whether the programmer wants them or not.
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> Buffer overflows are usually a <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#dos">Denial-of-Service</A>

	job both ensuring that Microsoft is who they say they are, and that Microsoft has
	done a reasonably good job protecting their <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#public">private keys</A> from theft.

	<P><B>Contrast:</B> Microsoft could create a "<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#self-signed">self-signed</A>" certificate,
	but then <I>anybody else</I> could create a self-signed certificate claiming to be Microsoft.
	Therefore, you trust a CA-signed certificate more than a self-signed certificate, as long as
	you trust the CA.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> How do you trust a CA? The answer is <B>marketing</B>. First, a company
	like Verisign has spent millions of dollars creating a reputable company that would be 
	destroyed if a flaw was found in their process (i.e. thieves were able to steal their
	<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#public">private keys</A>). Second, Versign (and a few other CAs) have managed
	to embed their public keys within Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. This means
	that any website using SSL must obtain a certificate signed by one of these built-in
	CAs, or else users get confusing warning messages.

	<P><B>Humor:</B> Microsoft uses certificates signed by Verisign, because it is trusted
	by many people. The reason so many people trust Verisign these days is because its
	root keys are included with Microsoft's browsers.


	<P><B>Key point:</B> One of the chief RISKS is the theft of the private key used to sign
	things. If a hacker/thief is able to steal it, then they can masquarade as someone

	<P><B>Key point:</B> Several important CA certificates (i.e. Verisign) expired on Dec. 31, 1999.
	Since it is feasable to eventually compromise a certificates, they usually expire
	at some date. The certificates for trusting root CAs that are built-in many
	browsers (Internet Explorer 4.0 and earlier, Netscape Navigator 4.06 and earlier)
	were created in 1995, and were made for a 5-year lifespan. One of the creators
	of these certificates now says he wished he'd put the expiration date a little
	off, such as on Dec. 15, in order to avoid the Y2K madness.

	This file was made readable by everyone, but the passwords were encrypted

	was valid, but you really couldn't decrypt the entry. (Note: not even administrators
	are able to figure out user's passwords; they can change them, but
	not decrypt them).
	However, a program called "<B>crack</B>" was developed that would simply
	test all the words in the dictionary against the passwords in <TT>/etc/passwd</TT>.
	This would find all user accounts whose passwords where chosen from the

<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="directory-traversal">directory traversal</A></B> <SMALL CLASS="level">[3]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	A common bug that is the source of many compromises.
	This bug comes about because a program does not parse the filename
	given to the program but simply passes it off to the system.
	Therefore, by prefixing file names with "../../..", the hacker
	can force the program to read any file on the system.
	
	<P><B>Example:</B> Many programs contain built-in HTTP servers. This allows
	the program to be remotely managed from any web browser. These servers
	expect that only the files in their own directory and below will
	be read. However, hackers can still provide <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#url-encode">URLs</A> that go up directories,
	and down into other directories in order to read any file from
	the system. For example, a hacker might be able to read the 
	<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#etc-passwd">UNIX password file</A> by typing in the <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#url-encode">URL</A>:

	<P><B>Key point:</B> Win9x has the quirk that three dots "<TT>...</TT>" means "two directories up",
	four dots "<TT>....</TT>" means "three directories up", and so on. Additionally,
	whereas on many UNIX systems going up past the top directory automatically generates an error, going

	<P>
	A firewall acts as a "choke point". Corporations setup
	firewalls between their internal networks and the Internet.

	<P><B>Misconception:</B> Many people believe that a firewall

	The <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#ip">IP</A> protocol has the ability to fragment one large IP <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#packet">packet</A>
	into smaller packets. The receiver than reassembles them before forwarding the
	data up to the application, making this invisible. Fragmentation is necessary
	because IP is designed as an abstraction above local links. Since different
	links support different maximum packet sizes, some routers on the Internet
	can receive packets larger than can be transmitted along the next hop
	in the path. Therefore, IP allows 64-kilobyte packets even though
	most links cannot handle that size.




	<P><B>Example:</B> 
	Ethernet supports a maximum packet size of 1500 bytes. Therefore, in order to send
	an IP packet of 2000 bytes, the system must first fragment the packet into
	two pieces before transmission. The other end will then reassemble them back
	into a single packet on the other end.

	<P><B>Contrast:</B> The general concept of fragmentation applies to all layers

	had to deal with it. Therefore, the ATM adapter itself handles the fragmentation
	and presents a "virtual" interface that allows a full 64-kilobyte packet to be
	sent without IP level fragmentation. Conversely, when reading files from a file
	server, even a 64-kilobyte packet size is too small, so the file server layer automatically
	requests smaller parts of the file. In some cases, applications will attempt to calculate
	the <A NAME="mtu">MTU</A> (Maximum Transmission Unit) of the connection in order to 
	optimize operations to avoid any IP fragmentation.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> IP fragmentation is slow, and is better handled either below the IP

	Therefore, there are numerous ways to hack this feature. Some attacks are:

		Each fragment has an offset (from start of the pre-fragmented packet) and

		65536, when added together, they can extend past the 65536 packet size limit.
		Prior to 1995, few systems checked for this, allowing fragmented packets

		in order to <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/network-intrusion-detection.html#9.4" CLASS="external">evade</A> the IDS.
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> Fragmentation is almost never needed. Most communication runs
		over TCP, which does its own "segmentation" which is more efficient. Therefore, if you see any fragmentation
		on your network, you should examine it closely to see if it indicates an attack.


<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="ftp">FTP</A></B> (<A NAME="file-transfer-protocol">File Transfer Protocol</A>)<SMALL CLASS="level">[2]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	
	Before <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#http">HTTP</A>, FTP was the most
	popular protocol for downloading files across the Internet. 
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> FTP uses an outgoing control connection that only sends
	commands to the server and receives returned status information. All data is
	transfered on <I>separate</I> connections (one connection for each file or directory
	transfered).

	<P><B>Key point:</B> The control connection is text based,
	so you can use <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#telnet">Telnet</A> or <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#netcat">netcat</A>
	as your client (if you understand the protocol).

	<P><B>Key point:</B> Before the web (and graphical <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#browser">browsers</A>)
	people used command-line versions of FTP. These are still prefered
	by hackers, becauase GUIs are often too "noisy" (generating unnecessary
	commands). Such command-line clients that are still included in virtually
	all UNIX or Windows systems.
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> These separate connections are created by sending a <A NAME="ftp-port">PORT</A>
	command across the control connection. This command accepts both and IP address as well
	as port number that tells the other side where to connect. Example:
	<TT>PORT 192,2,0,201,10,1</TT> is the string sent across the control connection
	to tell the server that the client has opened a port on the machine with the 
	<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#ip-address">IP address</A> 192.2.0.201 with <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#port">port</A> 2561.
	The server will then open up a <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#tcp">TCP</A> connection as intructed.
	This command is sent invisibly when the client requests a directory listing
	or file; all the client sees of this happening is a status message to
	the effect <TT>200 PORT command successful.</TT> which is sent back across
	the control connection. A neat hack is to specify somebody else's 
	<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#ip-address">IP address</A> in this command. This hack
	is called a <I>bounce</I> attack, and can be used
	to <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#port-scan">port scan</A> computers or subvert <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#trust">trust</A>
	relationships.
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> An outgoing connection is used for control, but the data
	is sent on an incoming connection. Firewalls block incoming connections. Therefore,
	a user will see that they can connect to the FTP server, but directory listings
	and file transfers don't work.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> In order to solve the incoming connection problem, FTP
	supports a mode called <A NAME="ftp-pasv">PASV</A> that forces all connections
	to be outgoing. <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#browser">Web-browsers</A> like IE and Netscape
	use PASV mode by default. Command-line FTP clients typically don't support
	PASV; but people try "quote PASV" commands anyway.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> Lots of FTP servers have <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#buffer-overflow">buffer overflow</A>
	exploits in them.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> One of the precepts of Zen philosophy is that

	<P><B>Key point:</B> There are three levels of understanding, which can

	A <I>hacker</I> is someone who is able to manipulate the inner workings of 
	computers, information, and technology.
	<P>
	Consider Arthur C. Clark's Third Law:
	"<I>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic</I>".
	Since normal people have no clue as to how computers work,
	they often view hackers with suspicion and awe (as magicians,
	sorcerers, witches, and warlocks). This suspicion leads to the
	word "hacker" having the connotation of someone up to no good.
	
	<P><B>History:</B> The word "hacker" started out in the 14th century to mean somebody
	who was inexperienced or unskilled at a particular activity (such
	as a <A HREF="http://www.hacker.com/" CLASS="external">golf hacker</A>). 
	<P>
	In the 1970s, the word "hacker" was used by computer enthusiasts
	to refer to themselves. This reflected the way enthusiasts approach
	computers: they eschew formal education and play around with the
	computer until they can get it to work. (In much the same way, a golf
	hacker keeps hacking at the golf ball until they get it in the hole).
	<P>
	Furthermore, as "experts" learn about the technology, the more they realize
	how much they don't know (especially about the implications of 
	technology). When experts refer to themselves as "hackers", they are
	making a Socratic statement that they truely know nothing.
	For more information on this connotation, see
	There is still a large community
	of enthusiasts who use this word with only that connotation,
	such as in 
	<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/" CLASS="external">ESR</A>'s
	"Hacker Dictionary".
	<P>
	<P><B>Key point:</B> Today if you do a quick search of "hacker" in a search engine,
	you will still occasional uses of the word in senses
	used in the 1400s and 1970s, but the overwhelming usage in the 1990s
	describes people who break into computers using
	their sorcerous ways. Likewise, the vast majority of websites
	with the word "hack" in their title refer to illegitimate
	entry into computer systems, with notable exceptions like
	<A HREF="http://www.hacker.com/" CLASS="external">http://www.hacker.com</A> (which refers to golf).
		
	<P><B>Controversy:</B> The <I>computer-enthusiast</I> community often refers to any malicious
	<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#hacker">hacker</A> as a "<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#cracker">cracker</A>". 
	The <I>security-community</I> restricts the use of the word "<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#cracker">cracker</A>"
	to some who breaks encryption and copy-protection schemes. 
	<P>
	Consequently, a journalist who writes about cybercriminals cannot use either
	word without hate mail from the opposing community claiming they are using
	the word incorrectly. If a journalists writes about <I>hackers</I> breaking into 
	computers, they will receive hate-mail claiming
	that not all hackers are malicious, and the that the correct word is "cracker". 
	Likewise, if they write about <I>crackers</I> breaking into computers,
	they will receive hate-mail claiming that crackes only break codes, but its
	hackers who break into systems. The best choice probably depends upon the audience;
	for example one should definately talk about malicious crackers in a computer-enthusiast
	magazine like "Linux Today".

	The word "harden" implies putting a shell around a computer in order to protect it from

	<LI>Remove all defaults. In order to make their software easy-to-use, vendors include

	<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="background: #ffffee; font-size: smaller">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to
say on the subject of towels.
<P>
   A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an
interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical
value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound
across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the
brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the
heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which
shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a
miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in
hand-to-hand combat; wrap it round your head to ward off
noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter 
Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly stupid animal, it assumes
that if you can't see it, it can't see you-daft as a brush, but
very very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies
as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it
still seems to be clean enough. 
<P>
   More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.
For some reason, if a strag (strag: nonhitchhiker) discovers
that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically
assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth,
soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat
spray, wet-weather gear, space suit, etc., etc. Furthermore, the
strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a
dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have
"lost." What the strag will think is that any man who can
hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, rough it, slum it,
struggle against terrible odds, win through and still know
where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.
<P>
   Hence a phrase that has passed into hitchhiking slang, as in
"Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood
who really knows where his towel is." (Sass: know, be aware
of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood:
really amazingly together guy.)

	generally takes place only at the start of a connection, this will

	<P><B>Example:</B> ISPs generally reassign IP addresses of dialing users very
	quickly after a previous user hung up. Take for example where Alice dials up

	that automatically hijacks any existing connection. The server then sends some response
	packet back across the connection to Alice (really Mark). At that point, Mark's stack
	automatically picks up the connection and continues the protocol. At this point,

	Every extra bit of key length means the key will take twice as long to crack. Therefore,

	All data sent across the Internet is broken up into
	packets, sent individually across the network, and reassembled
	back into the original data at the other end.
	
	<P><B>Analogy:</B> Imagine looking at an automobile freeway during
	rush hour from an airplane. The freeway looks like a flowing river,
	but each individual car (packet) is really independent from all
	the others. While it looks like the cars on the freeway are
	going in the same direction, each car really has its own source
	and destination separate from the others around it. This is how
	Internet core routes look. 
	
	<P><B>Analogy:</B> Now consider that a bunch of coworkers
	leave the office and go to a party. Each gets in his/her own car
	and drives to the party. Each person may take a slightly route,
	but they all end up together at the party. This demonstrates
	how data is broken up into individual packets, sent across
	the Internet (potentially following different routes), then
	reassembled back again at the destination.
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> Conceptually, networking occurs at
	abstract layers well above the concept of packets. Users type
	in a <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#url-encode">URL</A>, and the file is downloaded. By dealing with the
	raw packets themselves, hackers are frequently able to
	subvert communications in ways not detectable at these higher 
	layers.

	<P><B>Contrast:</B> The term 
	"<A NAME="packet-switched-network">packet switched network</A> (<A NAME="psn">PSN</A>)"
	is used to describe the Internet, whereas the term
	"<A NAME="circuit-switched-network">circuit switched network</A> (<A NAME="csn">CSN</A>)"
	is used to contrast it with the traditional phone system. 
	The key difference is that in the phone system, the route
	between two people is setup at the start, and each bit
	in the stream follows that route. On the Internet, each
	packet finds its own route through the system, so during
	a conversation, the packets can follow different paths,
	and indeed arrive out-of-order. Another key difference
	is latency. The phone system forwards each bit one at a time,
	so as soon as one arrives, it doesn't have to wait before
	forwarding it on. On the Internet, bits are bunched together
	before transmission. Each hop must wait and receive all the bits
	before forwarding any of them on. Each hop therefore adds 
	a significant amount of delay. Gamers know this as the

	Social engineering is a form of hacking that targets people's minds
	rather than their computers. A typical example is sending out snail

	departments of corporations.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> The classic example is to pretend to be from
	a company's computer department and call up a user asking for
	their password. Sophisticated hacks will first try to make
	the victim uncomfortable (i.e. "We've detected improper
	use of your account..."), then offer them the opportunity
	to be very helpful ("I'm sure we can check this out now
	and not involve your boss."). The technique often works well
	in reverse: call up the computer support department and tell
	them you've lost your password. This works especially well
	in companies that have policies requiring you to change
	your password -- people forgetting passwords on really

	The word "spoof" generally means the act of forging your identity. More specifically, it
	refers to forging the sender's <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#ip-address">IP address</A> (IP spoofing). 

	<P><B>Analogy:</B> When you send a letter via normal post (snail mail), you
	write the recipient's name and address on the envelope. You typically also
	write the sender's name and address as well, so that if there is an error
	forwarding you letter (e.g. a stamp falls off), they know who sent the
	letter and can return it. However, you can easily spoof it. For example,
	someone I know absolutely had to send a letter, but had no stamps.
	So he simply put the actual recipient's name as the return
	address section of the envelope and dropped it into the mail box. The
	letter was returned to sender, which of course arrived at the intended
	recipient.
	
	<P><B>Misconception:</B> Most people are interested in spoofing because they
	think it will allow them to hack a machine in a completely <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#anonymous">anonymous</A>
	manner. It doesn't work this way. For example, Mitnick used IP spoofing
	in order to attack Shimomura's computers, but was caught anyway because
	spoofing does not truely hide the attacker. The problem is that all responses
	go back to the sender, so if you've spoofed the sender, you'll never
	see the responses. Therefore, the spoofing is useless for any normal
	activity. On the other hand, spoofing can still be useful in situations
	where seeing the response is not necessary. In the Mitnick instance,
	two machines trusted each other. Therefore, Mitnick was able to emulate
	and entire connection between the two machines by "predicting" what
	all the responses would be. He used this connection to open up something
	on the victim machine that he could then connect to normally. It was
	precurser scanning the and the post-spoof connection that Shimomura used
	to catch Mitnick.

	<P><B>Example:</B> A particularly nasty form of a spoofing is 
	<B>TCP sequence number prediction</B>. Theoretically, you cannot
	spoof any protocol based upon TCP connections. This is because
	both sides of a TCP connection choose their own <B>Initial Sequence Number (ISN)</B>.
	In theory, this is a completely random number that cannot be guessed.
	In practice, it can sometimes be easily guessed. Mitnick used
	this technique when hacking Shimomura. As of the end of 1999,
	operating systems such as Linux, WinNT, and Win2k have implemented
	truely randmon ISNs in order to defeat this type of attack.

	<P><B>Example:</B> In terms of volume of traffic, the most common use
	of spoofing today is <I>smurf</I> and <I>fraggle</I> attacks. These 
	attacks spoofed packets against <I>amplifiers</I> in order to
	overload the victim's connection. This is done by sending a single
	packet to a broadcast address with the victim as the source address.
	All the machines within the broadcast domain then respond back
	to the victim, overloading the victim's Internet connection. Since smurfing
	accounts for more than half the traffic on some backbones, ISPs are
	starting to take spoofing seriously and have started implementing measures
	within their routers that verify valid source addresses before passing
	the packets. As a consequence, spoofing will become incresingly more difficult
	as time goes on.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> Most of the discussion of spoofing centers around
	clients masquarading as somebody else. On the other hand, the reverse
	problem is equally worrisome: hackers can often spoof servers. For example,
	I post on my website that there is a serious security fix needed to
	protect yourself while on the web, and point you to 
	<B STYLE="color:blue">http://www.micrsoft.com</B> and hope that you never
	notice that the URL is misspelled. You would then go to that site (which would
	be really my server) and download the patch, which would really be a
	<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#trojan">Trojan Horse</A> that I designed in order to break into
	your computer. This is why server-side <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#certificate">certificates</A>
	are important: some indepdent party validates that the server isn't bogus.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> As the analogy with postal mail shows, many things can be forged,
	not just the sender's IP address. Most spammers forge their sender's e-mail
	address in order to avoid all the hate mail they will receive in response.
	Forging your own sender e-mail address is as simple as reconfiguring
	your e-mail client -- anybody can do it. (However, there are more secrets
	to this, which mean you can still be caught by any determined person).

	An important aspect of all <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#os">operating systems</A> is a feature
	called "virtual memory". This allows the OS to take unused pieces of memory
	and write them to disk, then free up the block of memory just written so
	that another active application can use it. Whenever somebody needs that
	block again, the operating system will automatically restore it from
	the disk. Of course, it will then have to free up another block to do so
	by writing that block to the disk.
	<P>This process is generally called
	"swapping" or "paging". The word "swap" reflects the fact that inactive
	blocks of memory are being switched with active blocks from the disk. The word
	"paging" reflects the fact that a common name for a block of memory is
	"page". The name of the file on the disk that an OS uses for swapping is

	<P><B>Key point:</B> A lot of security depends upon the fact that

	passwords in <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#clear-text">clear-text</A> in memory.
	Swapping defeats this, because the memory pages that store
	the passwords may have been swapped to the disk. Someone with
	physical access to the machine can turn it off, steal the
	disk, and run the pagefile through analysis programs in order
	possibly retrieve passwords.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> There really is no "UNIX", but just various implementations

	<P><B>Contrast:</B> There have been two main branches of UNIX:

	<P><B>Example:</B> Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, SCO, SGI Irix, Apple A/UX,
	BSD, HP/UX.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> UNIX is case-sensitive, whereas Windows and Macintosh

	<P><B>Key point:</B> The <A NAME="bsd">BSD</A> branch has spawned

	<P><B>How to:</B> In order to harden UNIX, you generally do the following:
	<UL>
	<LI>Always start from a fresh machine newly installed. When installing,
		do not install any options that aren't absolutely necessary. Many
		people are unsure if an option is needed, so they install it just
		to be sure. Do the opposite (don't install it in order to make sure
		you don't introduce a backdoor).
	<LI>After installation, remove all unnecessary software; anything with an
		<A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#x-windows">X Windows</A> GUI is a good start.
	<LI>Cleanse <TT><A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#etc-inetd.conf">/etc/inetd.conf</A></TT> of all 
		unnecessary services. For any server connected to the Internet,
		pretty much everything in there will be unnecessary.
	<LI>Install a <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#tripwire">Tripwire</A>-style package to detect
		when system files have changed (i.e. binaries in /sbin and configuration
		files in /etc). This doesn't secure the system, but it helps in

	A virus is a piece of code that, when run, will attach itself to other programs, which 
	will again run when those programs are run.

	<P><B>Analogy:</B> A biological virus is not a "living" thing. Instead, it is simply
	a strand of DNA. When it enters a living cell, it takes control of the cell forcing
	it to generate duplicate copies of the original DNA strand. In much the same way,
	a computer virus hijacks the computer forcing it to generate duplicate copies of
	the original virus. Computer viruses are so common because humans do not practice sufficient
	cyber-hygene when exchanging files.
	
	<P><B>Key point:</B> An "<A NAME="anti-virus">anti-virus</A>" programs scans the disks on your system

	really mean is that the hacker put some sort of hostile program (usually
	a <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#rat">remote access Trojan</A>) which is not any sort of virus at all.
	While the hacker's program will indeed try to ensconce itself deeply

<P><DT><B CLASS="word"><A NAME="vpn">VPN</A></B> (<A NAME="virtual-private-network">Virtual Private Network</A>)<SMALL CLASS="level">[3]</SMALL><DD CLASS="def">
	A VPN allows the user to remotely connect to a company, via the Internet, with a secure
	connection that makes it appear ("virtually") as if the machine is on the corporate LAN.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> VPNs are used for employee-company and company-company connections.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> One way that an employee can connect to a company is to put
	a modem in the machine and dial directly to modems inside the corporation. This is
	expensive due to long distance charges. But think for a moment that the employee
	can purchase two modems to put in the machine, and while dialed up to the corporation,
	the employee also dials up the Internet. This would mean that the employee has two
	active network connections: one to the corporation, one to the Internet. A VPN is 
	the same thing, only the corporate connection and modem are "virtual".

	<P><B>Key point:</B> Vendors claim that when the VPN is active, that the previous
	Internet access is disabled and all further communication goes through the corpration.
	Therefore, if the user wants to browse the web while the VPN is active, the
	user must browse through firewalls/proxies inside the corporation then back
	out to the web. However, this is just a bit of sleight-of-hand: while it appears
	to the user that normal Internet communication has been disabled, in reality it
	has only been "hidden": a hacker can still compromise the machine from the Internet.

	<P><B>Key point:</B> VPN puts the connection on the company's internal network, inside
	the firewall. Therefore, if a hacker compromises someone's machine who uses
	VPN, then the hacker has easy access to the inside of a hardened corporate environment.

	Wardialing was popularized in the 1983 movie <A HREF="http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/hacking-dict.html#war-games">War Games</A>.
	It is the process of dialing all the numbers in a range in order to find
