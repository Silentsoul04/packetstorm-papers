    - Internet connection

    - Telnet  client
    - Notepad

1.0 What is Wingate ?

WinGate is a proxy server firewall software package that allows you to share 
a single (or multiple) Internet connections with an entire computer network.
The Internet connection shared by WinGate can be of nearly any type, 
including dial up modem, ISDN, xDSL, cable modem, satellite connection, or 
even dedicated T1 circuits.

1.1 Why would I use it ?

Well it is very simple. Think of  Wingate as a gate to the internet. Once you
find one, you can use it to connect to any network or computer that you wish.
But I can do that with my own box you say...well the benefit of a Wingate 
server is that it will hide your IP to the computer you are connecting to, it
will only reveal the Wingate servers IP and not your own (if at this point 
you still don't see how this could be helpfull in hacking, QUIT). However,
some Wingate servers keep logs and thus you could be traced, solution, link 
multiple Winagte servers before you start hacking.


1.2 How could I use it ?


Here comes the interesting part. Let's say I have 5 Wingate server IP's to 
work with :

200.231.12.1  -> A
124.103.43.5  -> B
190.233.12.1  -> C
189.121.32.4  -> D
200.232.22.1  -> E

Run your telnet application and connect to port 23 of A (above), this is the
prompt you will get:

WinGate>

>From there connect to B like this :

WinGate>124.103.43.5

This will connect you to B , then do the same from B to C to D and E. Thus we have
this sort of a chain :

your BOX -> your ISP -> A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> any box you want to hack


>From E you could connect to a hacked shell account or a free shell account that
you setup with (I hope) fake information. This process of chaining will hide your
IP and make you hard (but not impossible) to trace. If you are still confused,
this is what happens :

only A sees your real IP - B sees A's IP - C sees B's IP and so on...........

To connect to different ports (because by default you will be connecting to 
the Telnet port 23) this is what you do :

WinGate>121.433.23.1:port_number

FTP = 21 ; SMPT = 25 ; FINGER = 79

Final note, many administrators will rather patch the hole in their system
rather then trace your ass through 6 or more WinGates, so it is pretty safe.

1.3 How could I find one ?

Well, you need a WinGate scanner which you can download from the link below
(working 13/09/98) and scan domains. This will be very time consuming. Here is
a better way :

Connect to Warez,Hacking,Phreaking channels on IRC and scan peoples domain
names. Many of the parties involved have bounced through a WinGate
server and thus you will be able to find them much quicker. But what do you
mean "bouced through a WinGate server", well that's another 
publication................................................................

Also try "/stats g " in one of these channels : #hackphreak ; #warez950
