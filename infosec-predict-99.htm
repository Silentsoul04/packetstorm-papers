For &#146;99</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><IMG SRC="Fig1CS.gif" WIDTH="257" HEIGHT="166" ALIGN="RIGHT"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">In 1999, security management will
take center stage in most every IT organization. What about the
Year 2000 problem, you ask? For many organizations, the Y2K bug
will soon be a problem of the past. (In fact, if you&#146;re not
compliant yet, you might want to brush up your r&eacute;sum&eacute;.)
In coming months, organizations will begin to redirect resources
previously earmarked for the millennium bug to the challenge of
building a secure &quot;virtual organization.&quot;</P>

<P>Success in 1999 will be a measure of how well companies leverage
electronic business applications to differentiate themselves from
their competition. During this process, organizations of all shapes
and sizes will need to adjust to fundamental changes in their
approach to and management of IT services. These changes will
affect both the macro- and micro-levels of the enterprise, including
virtually all areas of information security&#151;access control,
secure communications, data and information integrity, resource
management, perimeter protection&#133;the list goes on. In short,
<I>get ready for a wild ride</I>.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">1. Applications Will Have Millions of Moving
Parts</FONT></B></P>

<P>Over the next 12 months, new business applications will be
developed with separate components for each major area of the
enterprise&#146;s functionality. At any time, millions of application
components will be constantly moving around the corporate network,
from application servers to users&#146; desktops&#151;both inside
and outside the company&#146;s walls.</P>

<P>In a company&#146;s accounting application, for example, the
order-entry function will be a separate component, deployed in
the form of an applet that can be easily downloaded through a
Web browser. With the appropriate security measures in place,
customers will be able to enter orders by accessing the order-entry
component through a company&#146;s firewall. To say the least,
discerning who is doing what will be a challenge, and ensuring
round-the-clock security will be difficult. But the rewards of
a well-secured &quot;virtual enterprise&quot; are clear: efficiency,
reduced overhead and increased sales.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">2. Companies Will Establish Numerous Security
Perimeters</FONT></B></P>

<P>The only plausible course of action in securing this fluid
computing environment will be to step back and retrench. Companies
will establish software security perimeters at numerous levels
of the computing infrastructure. Network security perimeters will
maintain the integrity of certain areas of the corporate network.
Server security perimeters will be built around the OS on each
server and around the desktop computers of the most influential
users. Application security perimeters will limit and control
access to each business application. Database security perimeters
will solidify the protection of the corporation&#146;s business
information&#151;its most valuable asset. Even individual user&#146;s
accounts will be fortified with security perimeters.</P>

<P>This &quot;divide-and-conquer&quot; approach to security may
be the only manageable response to the growing number of security
threats facing the enterprise. Why? Because more and more security
break-ins are being perpetrated across country borders, and there
is very little in the way of legal precedent or international
law that enables government intervention.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">3. Firewalls Will Become More Adaptive</FONT></B></P>

<P>Most every corporation views the firewall as the foundation
for their network security perimeter. The easiest type of firewall
to deploy is a packet filter, but such firewalls are easily circumvented
by an attacker masquerading as an IP address that is</P>

<P>allowed through the firewall. A number of companies have migrated
to proxy server firewalls, which have a separate proxy for every
application that is accessible from outside the company&#146;s
perimeter.</P>

<P>The downside to proxy servers is that the overhead required
to run an application proxy is considerably higher than that for
a packet filter. Consequently, the transition has been a painful
experience for companies that cannot afford to have their network
traffic slowed down substantially. In 1998, a few vendors (such
as Check Point and Network Associates) began manufacturing &quot;hybrid
firewalls&quot; to address this problem. As their name suggests,
hybrid firewalls combine the best of both worlds: the speed of
a packet filter and the stringent security features of an application
proxy. As traffic accelerates during peak hours, packet filtering
is used as the default function. But if there is a perceived threat
to the firewall, the application proxies take over. In many cases,
once a connection has been established through a proxy, all subsequent
traffic is simply filtered, thereby balancing speed with security.
As the need for security increases, expect to see more hybrid
firewalls released in 1999.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">4. Personal Firewalls Will Take Off</FONT></B></P>

<P>The &#146;99 market for firewalls will expand in other significant
ways as well. Growing concerns about electronic privacy and increasing
media coverage of cracking exploits will prompt many home PC users
to seek out personal firewalls. Such firewalls will not only inhibit
external attempts to attack the home PC, but also prohibit the
PC from accessing inappropriate Internet material and services&#151;exactly
the solution many parents are calling for today.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">5. Securing Business Partner Access Will
Become Easier</FONT></B></P>

<P>Perhaps the single biggest reason for building application-specific
proxies is to allow your remote business partners to gain access
to your internal business applications. The problem is, the traffic
flowing between partners&#146; firewalls remains unprotected,
which has prompted many companies to deploy two primary techniques
for protecting their communications:</P>

<P><I>Encryption.</I> Many companies now encrypt and decrypt e-mail
text and any attachments sent between two parties. The drawback
to this approach is two-fold: First, the sender must manually
invoke the encryption product; and second, the receiver must have
the same encryption product as the sender in order to decrypt
the transmission. Over the coming year, there will be broader
acceptance of products that are compliant with S/MIME (Secure
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension), an e-mail standard that
makes this type of communication secure and transparent to the
user.</P>

<P><I>VPNs</I>. As with personal encryption tools, establishing
a virtual private network (VPN) traditionally required homogeneous
implementation across all parties wanting to use the secure connection.
While most VPN solutions can interoperate, the standard for automatically
negotiating encryption key exchanges&#151;IPSec&#151; is still
not fully developed. In 1999, more VPN products will support the
IPSec standard, providing for interoperability across heterogeneous
VPNs and making key exchanges automatic. This, in turn, will enable
multiple companies to establish VPNs without compromising the
integrity of their respective network perimeters.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">6. Viruses Will Take on New Life Forms</FONT></B></P>

<P>Even with a healthy network security perimeter, a company&#146;s
computer systems will be under attack from viruses and malicious
mobile code. Since inbound viruses can still slip through many
firewalls as e-mail attachments, companies have started to implement
&quot;virus walls&quot; on their firewalls to detect and remove
them. Nevertheless, viruses are still getting through as encrypted
or compressed attachments, which the virus wall cannot detect.
Similarly, virus walls usually can&#146;t detect viruses sent
through a VPN connection, which also encrypts traffic. To address
these problems, more and more organizations will move the virus
wall inside the termination points of a VPN, allowing it to read
attachments after they have been decrypted.</P>

<P>Macro viruses are quickly going out of date. Sure, they are
still &quot;breeding in the wild,&quot; automatically generating
children viruses with new signatures. But in &#146;99, a far more
serious threat will come from hostile mobile code, which is downloaded
transparently from Web sites on the Internet. The code takes the
form of a Java applet or browser plug-in, and is extremely easy
to develop. While it does not behave like a typical virus, replicating
itself at will, mobile code can have a more devastating effect
than many viruses.</P>

<P>Hostile code can be simply annoying, causing a Web browser,
for instance, to continuously bark like a dog. But it can also
be malicious, sending damaging e-mails from an unsuspecting user&#146;s
mail client. The problem is getting so bad that as many as two-thirds
of corporations have disabled the ability for users to download
Java applets, according to a recent survey by Hurwitz Group. A
few security vendors, including Finjan and Security-7, are working
on addressing this serious and growing security problem.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">7. Detecting Intruders Will Become Almost
Impossible</FONT></B></P>

<P>With new technologies being introduced almost daily into the
enterprise&#146;s computing systems, it is increasingly difficult
to guard all the doors. The network and OS alone yield hundreds
of potential points of attack. As new applications, databases
and middleware technologies are installed in &#146;99, hundreds
of additional access points will open up.</P>

<P>A network probe used to be sufficient for monitoring intrusion
attempts. But the proliferation of access points into each organization
will make it necessary to deploy intelligent agents on every critical
application server. These agents will not so much replace the
IDS at the network level as monitor for intrusion into the operating
systems, databases, middleware and business applications themselves.
Over the coming 12 months, IDS software will increasingly offer
the combined capability of network probes and intelligent agents
in a single solution.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">8. New Technologies Will Open More Security
Holes</FONT></B></P>

<P>The plethora of new doors into each computer system will also
need to be addressed by new risk/vulnerability assessment products.
Early assessment tools used a network probe to penetrate a system
and document its vulnerabilities. In 1998, the technologies matured
to a point where a network probe could use information taken from
one computer to break into another computer. And like IDS products,
risk assessment tools have evolved to include intelligent agents.
The agents on the market today already provide robust security
checks that look for virtually every way to break into a computer.
Over the coming year, these products will evolve even further,
to the point where they can detect risks in layered databases,
middleware and even applications.</P>

<P>The network probes and intelligent agents that provide risk
assessments will be combined into a single product offering by
many vendors in this market space. Moreover, because the functions
of risk assessment tools and IDS products frequently overlap,
several vendors (e.g., Centrax, ISS and Network Associates) will
combine their two product lines in these areas into a single comprehensive
solution. These solutions will provide internal and external intrusion
detection and risk assessment, all manageable from a single unified,
central management interface.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">9. Companies Will Emphasize Legal Evidence
of Break-ins</FONT></B></P>

<P>Centralized auditing is one area of security that remains largely
overlooked&#151;that is, until the company experiences a security
breach. Corporations are taking breaches far more seriously these
days, and they are far more inclined to prosecute trespassers
(provided they can catch them). But without a credible body of
legal evidence that a crime has been committed, there is no hope
of getting any prosecutor (federal, state or local) to take the
case to court. The problem revolves around audit logs, which are
left on the computers that generate them, offering an easy target
for intruders once the host has been breached.</P>

<P>To provide the type of evidence needed for prosecution, it
is necessary to capture, in real-time, the audit records of the
OS, databases, middleware and applications and send them to a
central location for safekeeping. Today, a number of companies
perform this function using event management tools such as BMC&#146;s
Patrol, HP&#146;s OpenView and IBM/Tivoli&#146;s TME10. Once stored
in a central location, the challenge is to format each audit log
entry into a uniform structure, with a normalized timestamp, so
that an accurate chronology of events can be reconstructed across
the entire computing architecture. As more companies discover
that they cannot prosecute intruders without sufficient evidence,
the market for centralized auditing tools will accelerate quickly.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">10. User Communities Will Grow Into the
Millions</FONT></B></P>

<P>The wave of corporate mergers in 1998 caused user communities
in hundreds of U.S. companies to double or even triple overnight.
The swelling ranks of end-users places a heavy burden on IT staff,
who are forced to manage more user account information with often
the same computing resources. On top of this, the deployment of
electronic business applications requires IT staff to manage external
users&#146; accounts as well, which may number in the millions.
The directory products on the market today have tremendous difficulty
in supporting environments of this scale.</P>

<P>In 1999, every company with a user base (internal and external)
in excess of</P>

<P>2 million will have to adopt an LDAP directory strategy to
regulate any IT purchases that contain divergent directory services.
Companies will begin to roll out architectures that employ federated
directories&#151;directories that are hierarchically segmented
across the enterprise, yet fully interoperable.</P>

<P>Microsoft, Netscape, Novell and Sun Microsystems all have aspirations
of dominating the directory market in &#146;99; once a vendor
&quot;owns&quot; a company&#146;s user accounts, that company
usually will stick with that supplier through thick and thin.
This in turn enables the vendor to control spending on other security
products. So choose your federated directory vendor wisely.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">11. The Corporate Walls Will Come Tumbling
Down</FONT></B></P>

<P>1999 will be the year the traditional corporate walls crumble.
To remain competitive, companies will need to have the ability
to do business electronically with partners, remote employees
and customers. With all these users entering the enterprise from
different points of entry, it will be nearly impossible to determine
where one company ends and the next begins.</P>

<P>The more virtual a corporation becomes, the greater its chances
are of responding to market demands and succeeding competitively.
The risk, of course, is that a virtual corporation will be dangerously
insecure.</P>

<P>To become more nimble, corporations are replacing legacy applications
with packaged applications, such as SAP R/3. They are also developing
e-business applications that</P>

<P>extend their ability to do business. The figure above illustrates
the relationships between the 10 major departmental areas of any
corporation. The image shows the various types of packaged applications
being aggressively deployed in each area of the business.</P>

<P>For example, enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications
(such as SAP R/3 and PeopleSoft) are being implemented across
the four traditional corporate resource departments: IT (information),
human resources (people), finance (money) and facilities (physical
assets). Similarly, other packaged applications are being implemented
in each of the six traditional production line departments. The
Sales group is implementing sales force automation (SFA) applications,
while Professional Services is rolling out project management
(PM) applications. Customer Support is concentrating on customer
relationship management (CRM), and Marketing is deploying enterprise
marketing automation (EMA) applications. Engineering is rolling
out product development management (PDM) software, while manufacturing
has been attempting (for what seems like a decade) to deploy material
resource planning (MRP) applications.</P>

<P>Layered on top of each department in the production line are
the six types of e-business applications that will dominate the
market over the coming year. E-marketing applications are the
basic Web identity sites that every company is implementing today.
From there, most companies make the foray into an e-sales application,
through which they hope to sell their products and services over
the Internet. To further differentiate their offerings from their
competition&#146;s, many companies then venture into providing
e-service applications (like Amazon.com&#146;s cross-referencing
of buyers&#146; interests in other books) and e-support applications
(like Federal Express&#146; Web site, which allows real-time tracking
of shipped packages). Many companies are even looking to develop
e-supply applications, through which they can build an integrated
supply chain with their suppliers and customers. And some have
gone as far as to build e-engineering applications, which allow
collaborative product development between corporate engineering
organizations across their respective firewalls.</P>

<P>The hidden reality here is that these electronic business applications
provide external access deep within a company&#146;s computing
infrastructure. This type of access is unprecedented in the industry
and is becoming the major driving factor of the security market.</P>

<P>&COPY; 1998 Hurwitz Group Inc.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">12. Single Sign-On Will Move Into the Mainstream</FONT></B></P>

<P>One result of the growth in the size of user communities is
an increase in the number of users forgetting their passwords.
A recent Hurwitz Group study reveals that some 61 percent of all
helpdesk calls are related to forgotten passwords. While handling
these requests in a productive manner continues to be a challenge
for corporate IT, a far more serious threat to business productivity
comes from customers who have forgotten their passwords to an
e-commerce application. For example, if a customer forgets his
password into Charles Schwab&#146;s e-Schwab application, he can&#146;t
make stock trades, resulting in a revenue loss for Charles Schwab.1999
will bring increased appreciation for the value of single sign-on
(SSO) solutions, which effectively reduce the number of logon
IDs and passwords that users have to remember. In the short term,
companies will turn to script-based SSO solutions, which learn
and automatically apply the logon processes for all existing applications&#151;without
modifying any of them. While a script-based technique will satisfy
the SSO needs for internal users, it is not sufficient to meet
the needs of external users, such as customers and business partners.
As the year progresses, there will be a migration toward broker-based
SSO, which employs certificate authorities and digital certificates
that are trusted across multiple corporations.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">13. Certificate-Based Authentication Will
Move Up</FONT></B></P>

<P>Certificate authorities (CAs) and digital certificates are
quickly gaining momentum as the preferred method for authenticating
users. Currently, the prevailing standard for digital certificates
is X.509, though a working group of the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) is working on a standard called PKIX (PKI for X.509).
The promise of these standards has helped vendors such as GTE&#146;s
CyberTrust, Baltimore Tech., Entrust and VeriSign establish large
certificate bases in several Fortune 500 companies, such as FedEx
and Salomon Smith Barney.</P>

<P>In &#146;99, the growing popularity of digital certificates
and soft tokens will continue to erode interest in hardware-based
authentication solutions (e.g., token cards and smart cards).
However, smart cards will find a niche in multiuser network OS
environments and business-to-business e-commerce applications.
Moreover, existing digital certificate technologies still face
significant scalability challenges. For instance, the largest
CAs running in production sites today can handle no more than
250,000 certificates, with each user possessing no more than one
certificate. As a result, companies are deploying multiple CAs
internally to support a greater number of certificates. 1999 will
bring linear improvements in the scalability of CAs, to the point
that an individual CA will be able to support as many as 500,000
certificates.</P>

<P>Over the next 12 months, certificate-based authentication vendors
will need to address the issue of re-certification. If a company
believes its master CA has been compromised, all outstanding certificates
immediately become invalid, and all business processing that requires
user authentication comes to a screeching halt. For users to continue
work, certificates must be reissued&#151;a process that can take
days in a large environment. A few vendors, such as Diversinet,
claim to eliminate this requirement, but they are fighting an
uphill battle against the bigger, more entrenched vendors.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">14. Integrated Security Strategies Will
Gain Popularity</FONT></B></P>

<P>Confidentiality Encryption</P>

<P>Application Integrity Access Control Authorization</P>

<P>User Integrity User/Group SSO Authentication</P>

<P>System Integrity Virus Prevention Intrusion Detection Risk
Assessment Auditing</P>

<P>Network Integrity Firewalls Communication Security</P>

<P>&COPY; 1998 Hurwitz Group Inc.</P>

<P>The figure above illustrates an approach to an overall security
strategy used by many large corporations. In this strategy, all
security requirements are divided into 12 interrelated areas.
Corporations methodically tackle each area using separate products
and services, ensuring that all the relevant requirements in one
area are sufficiently addressed before moving on to the next.</P>

<P>In 1999, corporate security strategies will involve a fair
amount of integration between these product areas. Companies will
require such integrated security solutions to actively and automatically
respond to security problems. For example, if an intrusion attempt
is detected by the intrusion detection system (IDS), a firewall
will be notified and automatically configured to shut down inbound
traffic from the network address perpetrating the intrusion attempt.
Absent integrated security solutions capable of responding to
this type of situation, IT organizations will find themselves
building their own integration across platforms and security products.</P>

<P>In the lower left corner of the image are the areas with the
most mature security technologies. These areas have been, and
will continue to be, the first to be addressed by most companies.
The last areas to be addressed are those in the upper right corner.
Security markets such as encryption and authorization have been
the slowest security technologies to be adopted and, as a result,
have not matured as quickly as the other markets.</P>

<P>This chronological process of deploying security is dictated
by two driving factors. First, unlike the security requirements
in the top right of the figure, those in the lower left are easily
understood by senior management, and therefore more likely to
be funded. Second, the security products in the lower left are
easily implemented and do not require significant changes to the
existing IT infrastructure. By comparison, the products that apply
to the requirements in the upper right corner are invasive, requiring
substantial changes to the infrastructure to work properly.</P>

<P>Those market areas that fall along the skewed line from the
upper left corner down to the lower right corner are the hottest
security markets at the moment. Most any Request for Information
(RFI) put out by a corporate IT organization today will clearly
identify</P>

<P>requirements for security management products that address
the areas of user/group</P>

<P>administration, SSO, intrusion detection and communication/network
security. It is these areas that will experience the fastest revenue
growth over the coming 12 months.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">15. Operating Systems Will Be Hardened</FONT></B></P>

<P>As user accounts are afforded a greater degree of protection,
corporations will turn their attention to protecting their applications&#151;on
both desktops and servers&#151;inside and outside the corporate
walls. For external servers (such as Web servers), companies will
control access by hardening the environment in which the application
resides.</P>

<P>Inside the corporate walls, companies will mitigate the risk
of a compromise on any application server by compartmentalizing
administrative access privileges. That way, if an administrative
account is compromised, the potential for damage and business
disruption is limited. Products like SeOS from Memco Software
(now a subsidiary of Platinum Technology) provide this type of
functionality.</P>

<P>The threat of attacks via hostile mobile code will cause many
IT departments to deploy access control software to protect applications
installed on users&#146; desktops. Limiting the user&#146;s ability
to modify their desktop and application configurations will substantially
reduce the potential for downtime due to user modifications or
security attacks from viruses and hostile code. One vendor introducing
interesting technology in this area is WinVista, with their WinVista
Pro product.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">16. Granular Authorization Will Continue
to Lag</FONT></B></P>

<P>Another approach to restricting access is to authorize access
privileges to application objects and functions at a granular
level. By definition, technologies in this market require major
modifications to existing applications, and therefore are considerably
more difficult to implement in larger organizations. Historically,
this security area has been the slowest to materialize, and 1999
will be no different. But the need for authorizing granular privileges
in Web-based applications has put greater pressure on IT departments
to find a solution. Product offerings from HP, Gradient, enCommerce
and Internet Dynamics show promise in this area and will gain
market momentum in &#146;99.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">17. Real-Time Cryptography Will Arrive</FONT></B></P>

<P>All security management solutions fundamentally depend on cryptographic
algorithms for privacy and confidentiality. In the past, government
restrictions on the exportation of cryptography (primarily in
the United States) have inhibited the deployment of the strongest
encryption products. While the Clinton administration recently
relaxed restrictions on exporting 56-bit keys, the strongest crypto
algorithms must still get special export waivers.</P>

<P>The overhead required for encryption and decryption processing
has also inhibited full-scale deployment of cryptography across
the enterprise. To address this problem, in 1999 consumers of
security will begin to use more intelligent combinations of cryptographic
techniques. Public-key encryption will be used to create digital
certificates, while symmetric-key encryption will be used for
encrypting bulk data. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) will gain
further credibility thanks to its promise of improved speed and
efficiency. Finally, real-time applications will begin to implement
cryptography, with vendors such as Certicom and TriStrata poised
to take advantage of this market opportunity.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">18. Security Will Eclipse the Y2K Bug</FONT></B></P>

<P>In 1999, security will supplant the Y2K bug as the number one
concern of most IT departments. The sheer scope of this article
underscores just how challenging infosecurity in the new millennium
will be. Companies will have to address these issues by establishing
a comprehensive security strategy that enables them to deploy
electronic business applications that are safely integrated with
the enterprise&#146;s packaged applications. It won&#146;t be
easy. Hold on for a wild ride. And protect yourself, because no
one else will.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">19. Change Will Be Constant</FONT></B></P>

<P>It&#146;s no secret that infosec is an industry of change.
As organizations evolve into virtual businesses, new opportunities&#151;and,
consequently, new threats&#151;will continue to crop up daily.
The challenges of secure e-commerce will continue to test the
limits of technology; remote partners will require an increasingly
higher level of access to critical business applications and information;
hackers will develop new tools and techniques for breaking through
today&#146;s security barriers; savvy end-users explore new ways
to use (and abuse) their privileges&#133;the list goes on.</P>

<P>As the challenges evolve, so will the security tools and strategies.
The above predictions paint a portrait of the industry in &#146;99
based on research into current market directions and technology
trends. But the industry could grow in any number of unexpected
directions, some of which might be quite different from what&#146;s
predicted above. In any case, it&#146;s always wise to expect
the unexpected in infosecurity, because there&#146;s never a dull
moment.</P>
