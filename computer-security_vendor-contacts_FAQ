Vendor Security Contacts: Reporting Vulnerabilities and Obtaining New
Patches

The following FAQ is a list of security contacts to reach at various vendors
for reporting security vulnerabilities and obtaining new security related
patches.

With the rising number of people and hosts gaining access to the Internet,
the basic integrity of the Net needs to be maintained. Many of security
incidents that happen on Internet could have been avoided by installing
security patches that are available by vendors. It is important to get the
recent patches and ensure that your systems are configured properly. With
intruders and their underground network having quick access to security
vulnerabilities, it is important that administrators have security
information available and not rely on just One organization.

numbers of software that are involved.
