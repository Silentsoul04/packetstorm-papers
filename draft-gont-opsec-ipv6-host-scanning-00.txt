                     Host Scanning in IPv6 Networks
                 draft-gont-opsec-ipv6-host-scanning-00

Abstract

   IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4
   counterpart.  The standard /64 IPv6 subnets can (in theory)
   accommodate approximately 1.844 * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a
   much lower host density (#hosts/#addresses) than their IPv4
   counterparts.  As a result, it is widely assumed that it would take a
   tremendous effort to perform host scanning attacks against IPv6
   networks, and therefore IPv6 host scanning attacks have long been
   considered unfeasible.  This document analyzes the IPv6 address
   configuration policies implemented in most popular IPv6 stacks, and
   identifies a number of patterns in the resulting addresses lead to a
   tremendous reduction in the host address search space, thus
   dismantling the myth that IPv6 host scanning attacks are unfeasible.

2.  Introduction

   The main driver for IPv6 deployment is its larger address space
   [CPNI-IPv6].  This larger address space not only allows for an
   increased number of connected devices, but also introduces a number
   of subtle changes in several aspects of the resulting networks.  One
   of such changes is the reduced host density (Nr. of addresses/Nr. of
   hosts) of a typical IPv6 subnet: with default IPv6 subnets of /64,
   each subnet comprises for more than 1.844 * 10^19 addresses; however,
   the actual number of nodes in each subnet is likely to remain similar
   to that of IPv4 subnetworks (at most a few hundred nodes per subnet).
   This lower host-density has lead to the widely-established myth that
   IPv6 host-scanning attacks are unfeasible, since they would require a
   ridiculously long time (along with a tremendous amount of traffic) to
   be successfully performed.

   This document performs a careful analysis of how IPv6 addresses are
   generated, and sheds some light on the real size of the search space
   when performing an IPv6 host scanning attack, dismantling the myth
   that such IPv6 ahost scanning attacks are unfeasible.  Section 3
   discusses how address configuration is performed in IPv6, describes
   the IPv6 address generation algorithms currently implemented in
   popular IPv6 stacks, and identifies patterns in IPv6 addresses that
   can be leveraged to reduce the IPv6 address search space when
   performing host scanning attacks.  Section 5 describes previous work
   in the area of IPv6 host scanning, and explains its limitations. .
   Section 6 provides advice on how to mitigate IPv6 host scanning
   attacks.

3.  Address configuration in IPv6

   IPv6 incorporates two automatic address-configuration mechanisms:
   SLAAC (StateLess Address Auto-Configuration) [RFC4862] and DHCPv6
   (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6) [RFC3315].  SLAAC is
   the mandatory mechanism for automatic address configuration, while
   DHCPv6 is optional - however, most current versions of general-
   purpose operating systems support both.  In addition to automatic
   address configuration, hosts may employ manual configuration, in
   which all the necessary information is manually entered by the host
   or network administrator into configuration files at the host.

   The following subsections describe each of the possible configuration
   mechanisms/approaches in more detail.

3.1.  StateLess Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC)

   The basic idea behind SLAAC is that every host joining a network will
   send a multicasted solicitation requesting network configuration
   information, and local routers will respond to the request providing
   the necessary information.  SLAAC employs two different ICMPv6
   message types: ICMPv6 Router Solicitation and ICMPv6 Router
   Advertisement messages.  Router Solicitation messages are employed by
   hosts to query local routers for configuration information, while
   Router Advertisement messages are employed by local routers to convey
   the requested information.

   Router Advertisement messages convey a plethora of network
   configuration information, including the IPv6 prefix that should be
   used for configuring IPv6 addresses on the local network.  For each
   local prefix learned from a Router Advertisement message, an IPv6
   address is configured by appending a locally-generated Interface
   Identifier (IID) to the corresponding IPv6 prefix.

   The following subsections describe currently-deployed policies for
   generating the IIDs used with SLAAC.

3.1.1.  Interface-Identifiers embedding IEEE Identifiers

   Many network technologies generate the 64-bit interface identifier
   based on the link-layer address of the corresponding network
   interface card.  For example, in the case of Ethernet addresses, the
   IIDs are constructed as follows:

   1.  The "Universal" bit (bit 6, from left to right) of the address is
       set to 1





Gont                    Expires October 22, 2012                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             IPv6 Host Scanning                 April 2012


   2.  The word 0xfffe is inserted between the OUI (Organizationally
       Unique Identifier) and the rest of the Ethernet address

   For example, the MAC address 00:1b:38:83:88:3c would lead to the IID
   021b:38ff:fe83:883c.

   A number of considerations should be made about these identifiers.
   Firstly, as it should be obvious from the algorithm described above,
   two bytes (bytes 4-5) of the resulting address always have a fixed
   value (0xff, 0xfe), thus reducing the search space for the IID.
   Secondly, the first three bytes of these identifiers correspond to
   the OUI of the network interface card vendor.  Since not all possible
   OUIs have been assigned, this further reduces the IID search space.
   Furthermore, of the assigned OUIs, many could be regarded as
   corresponding to legacy devices, and thus unlikely to be used for
   Internet-connected IPv6-enabled systems, yet further reducing the IID
   search space.  Finally, in some scenarios it could be possible to
   infer the OUI in use by the target network devices, yet narrowing
   down the possible IIDs even more.

      For example, an organization known for being provisioned by vendor
      X is likely to have most of the nodes in its organizational
      network with OUIs corresponding to vendor X.

   These considerations mean that in some scenarios, the original IID
   search space of 64 bits may be effectively reduced to 2^24 , or n *
   2^24 (where "n" is the number of different OUIs assigned to the
   target vendor).

   Another interesting factor arises from the use of virtualization
   technologies, since they generally employ automatically-generated MAC
   addressses, with very specific patterns.  For example, all
   automatically-generated MAC addresses in VirtualBox virtual machines
   employ the OUI 08:00:27 [VBox2011].  This means that all SLAAC-
   produced addresses will have an IID of the form a00:27ff:feXX:XXXX,
   thus effectively reducing the IID search space from 64 bits to 24
   bits.

   VMWare ESX server provides yet a more interesting example.
   Automatically-generated MAC addresses have the following pattern
   [vmesx2011]:

   1.  The OUI is set to 00:05:59

   2.  The next 16-bits of the MAC address are set to the same value as
       the last 16 bits of the console operating system's primary IPv4
       address

Internet-Draft             IPv6 Host Scanning                 April 2012


   3.  The final eight bits of the MAC address are set to a hash value
       based on the name of the virtual machine's configuration file.

   This means that, assuming the console operating system's primary IPv4
   address is known, the IID search space is reduced from 64 bits to 8
   bits.

   On the other hand, manually-configured MAC addresses in VMWare ESX
   server employ the OUI 00:50:56, with the low-order three bytes being
   in the range 0x000000-0x3fffff (to avoid conflicts with other VMware
   products).  Therefore, even in the case of manually-configured MAC
   addresses, the IID search space is reduced from 64-bits to 22 bits.

3.1.2.  Privacy Addresses

   Privacy concerns [CPNI-IPv6] [Gont-DEEPSEC2011] regarding interface
   identifiers embedding IEEE identifiers led to the introduction of
   "Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Auto-configuration in IPv6"
   [RFC4941], also known as "privacy addresses" or "temporary
   addresses".  Essentially, "privacy addresses" produce random
   addresses by concatenating a random identifier to the auto-
   configuration IPv6 prefix advertised in a Router Advertisement.

      In addition to their unpredictability, these addresses are
      typically short-lived, such that even if an attacker were to learn
      one of these addresses, they would be of use for a reduced period
      of time.

   It is important to note that "privacy addresses" are generated in
   addition to traditional SLAAC addresses (i.e., based on IEEE
   identifiers): traditional SLAAC addresses are employed for incoming
   (i.e. server-like) communications, while "privacy addresses" are
   employed for outgoing (i.e., client-like) communications.  This means
   that implementation/use of "privacy addresses" does not prevent an
   attacker from leveraging the predictability of traditional SLAAC
   addresses, since "privacy addresses" are generated in addition to
   (rather than in replacement of) the traditional SLAAC addresses
   derived from e.g.  IEEE identifiers.

3.1.3.  Stable and random Interface Identifiers

   In order to mitigate the security implications arising from the
   predictable IPv6 addresses derived from IEEE identifiers, Microsoft
   Windows produced an alternative scheme for generating "stable
   addresses" (in repalcement of the ones embedding IEEE identifiers).
   The aforementioned scheme is allegedly an implementation of RFC 4941
   [RFC4941], but without regenerating the addresses over time.  The
   resulting interface IDs are constant across system bootstraps, and

Internet-Draft             IPv6 Host Scanning                 April 2012


   also constant across networks.

   Assuming no flaws in the aforementioned algorithm, this scheme would
   remove any patterns from the SLAAC addresses.

      However, since the resulting interface IDs are constant across
      networks, these addresses may still be leveraged for host tracking
      purposes.  [I-D.gont-6man-stable-privacy-addresses]

3.2.  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6)

   DHCPv6 is a stateful address configuration mechanism, in which a
   server (the DHCPv6 server) leases IPv6 addresses to IPv6 hosts.  As
   with the IPv4 counterpart, addresses are assigned acording to a
   configuration-defined address range and policy, with some DHCPv6
   servers assigned addresses sequentially, from a specific range.  In
   such cases, addresses tend to be predictable.

      For example, if the prefix 2001:db8::/64 is used for assigning
      addresses on the local network, the DHCPv6 server might
      (sequentially) assign addresses from the range 2001:db8::1 - 2001:
      db8::100.

   In most common scenarios, this means that the IID search space will
   be reduced from the origina 64 bits, to 8 or 16 bits.

3.3.  Manually-configured addresses

   In some scenarios, node addresses may be manually configured.  This
   is typically the case for IPv6 addresses assigned to routers, since
   router do not employ automatic address configuration.

   While network administrators are mostly free to select the IID from
   any value in the range 1 - 264 range, for the sake of simplicity
   (i.e., ease of remembering) they tend to select addresses with one of
   the following patterns:

   o  "low-byte" addresses: in which all bytes of the IID (except the
      lowest one) are set to 0.

   o  IPv4-based addresses: in which the IID encodes the IPv4-address of
      the network interface (as in 2001:db8::192.168.1.1)

   o  wordy addresses: which encode words (as in 2001:db8::dead:beef)

   Clearly, the first two patterns reduce the search space from the
   original 64 bits to roughly 8 bits (assuming the IPv4 address range
   is known for the case of "IPv4-based" addresses).  On the other hand,

   the search space for IPv6 wordy-addresses is probably larger and more
   complex, but still greatly reduced when compared to the original 64-
   bit search space.

4.  IPv6 address assignment in real-world network scenarios

   Table 1 and Table 2 provide a rough summary of the results obtained
   by [Malone2008] for IPv6 clients and IPv6 routers, respectively.
   These results are provided manly for completeness-sake, since they
   are the most comprehensive address-measurement results that have so
   far been made publicly available.

      We note, however, that evolution of IPv6 implementations, changes
      in the IPv6 address selection policy, etc., might limit (or even
      obsolete) the validity of these results.

5.  Previous work in the area of IPv6 host scanning

5.1.  IPv6 host scanning of remote networks

   IPv4 host scanning tools have traditionally carried out their task
   for probing an entire address range (usually the entire range of a
   target subnetwork).  One might argue that the reason for which they
   we have been able to get off with such somewhat "rudimentary" tools
   is that the scale of the "problem" is so small in the IPv4 world,
   that even such a "poor" job is "good enough".  However, the scale of
   the "host scanning" problem is so large in IPv6, that we must be very
   creative to be "good enough".

   Simply sweeping an entire /64 IPv6 subnet would just not be feasible.
   For instance, that is probably one of the reasons for which host
   scanning tools such as nmap [nmap2012] do not even support sweeping
   an IPv6 address range.

      The nmap(1) manual page states "IPv6 addresses can only be
      specified by their fully qualified IPv6 address or hostname.  CIDR
      and octet ranges aren't supported for IPv6 because they are rarely
      useful.

   The most "advanced" IPv6 scanning technique that we are aware of is
   that reported in [Ybema2010], in which the attacker seemed to be
   scanning specific IPv6 addressesbased on specific patterns.  However,
   it probably still falls into the category of "rudimentary".

   Clearly, the limitation of currently-available tools is that they
   lack of an "heuristics engine" that can help reduce the search space,
   such that the problem of IPv6 host scanning becomes tractable.

6.  Mitigations

   IPv6 host scanning attacks can be mitigated in a number of ways.  A
   non-exhaustive of the possible mitigations follows:

   o  Employ stable privacy-enhanced addresses
      [I-D.gont-6man-stable-privacy-addresses] in replacement of
      addresses based on IEEE identifiers, such that any address
      patterns are eliminated

   o  Employ Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) at the perimeter, such
      that host scanning attacks are mitigated

   o  If virtual machines are employed, and "resistance" to host
      scanning attacks is deemed as desirable, employ manually-
      configured MAC addresses

   It should be noted that some of the aforementioned mitigations are
   operational, while others depend on the availability of corresponding
   "patches".

   Additionally, while some resistance to host scanning attacks is
   generally desirable (particularly when lightweight mitigations are
   available), there are scenarios in which such mitigation is unlikely
   to be a high-priority (if at all possible).  Such scenarios include:

   o  Mitigation of IPv6 local host-scanning scans

   o  Mitigation of IPv6 host-scanning attacks in public-facing servers

   In general, it is only possible to mitigate some vectors for IPv6
   local host scanning attacks, but virtually impossible to completely
   mitigate them, particularly when a local attacker can rely on network
   snooping, and protocols employed for the so-called "opportunistic
   networking" (such as mDNS).  On the other hand, public-facing servers
   generally contain corresponding entries in the DNS, in which case an
   attacker can rely on the DNS for network reconnaissance.

   o  We note, however, that if any address patterns are eliminated from
      servers with entries in the DNS, an attacker may have to rely on
      using dictionaries with the DNS, which is generally less reliable
      and more time/traffic consuming than mapping nodes with
      predictable IPv6 addresses.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document demonstrates that the widely-established myth of IPv6
   host-scanning attacks being unfeasible is more based on "hope" than
   on careful analysis or facts.  We expect host scanning attacks to
   become more and more elaborated (i.e., less "brute force") as general
   deployment of IPv6 increases, and more specifically, as more IPv6-
   only devices are deployed.
