<HR></CENTER>


<P>The Foresight Computer Security Fact Forum is a critical discussion
of issues in computer security.&nbsp; This discussion is intended to cover
several competing protection models, including capabilities, access control
lists (ACLs), and the Java security model.

<P>The Fact Forum uses a new web tool, the <A HREF="http://crit.org/">Crit
Mediator</A>, to enable fine-grained, bidirectional, typed links to be
made among documents by those other than each document's author. This annotation
ability is expected to greatly <A HREF="http://www.foresight.org/WebEnhance/HPEK4.html">enhance
the effectiveness of debating</A> complex topics using the web. The mediator
enables you to add comments to the papers and discussions here, and to
see comments made by others.

<P>If you are not already seeing this page through the mediator, click
<A HREF="http://crit.org/http://crit.org/~foresight/CSFactForum.html">here</A>
or go to <A HREF="http://crit.org">http://crit.org</A> and type the URL
of this page into the mediator's text box. The mediator is not limited
to the computer security forum. It can be used to annotate any web page.

<P>
The discussion has been seeded with documents representing various
views from invited experts. For the moment, it is organized in three
parts:
<UL>
<LI>
What are the competing models of protection?</LI>

<LI>
What problems must these models address?&nbsp; This list will expand over
time.</LI>

<LI>
What solutions are already known to exist, or have emerged from the discussion
to date?</LI>
</UL>
If you are new to the discussion, you may find it useful to read a
background document on the <A
HREF="http://www.caplet.com/security/taxonomy/">framework of
concepts</A> underlying this Fact Forum before launching into active
debate. Another useful overview is <a
href="http://www.ce.chalmers.se/~ulfl/webmdemo/wmwork/www/security_122_1.html"><em>A
Structured Approach to Computer Security</em></a> by Tomas Olovsson.
<P>Once oriented, participants are encouraged to mark up the seed
documents and add new material.  <h1>General Background</h1>

<H1> Models of Protection</H1>

The current discussion addresses three models of protection:
capabilities, access control lists, and the Java security model.  In
all cases, the views expressed are those of the author only unless

  <h2>Other Models</h2>
  <ul>
    <P>If you have a different model you would like to see discussed,
    add a link to the words <em>different protection models</em>.
  </ul>
</ul>

<H1>Problems to be Solved</H1>
<p>
<ul>
  <h2>Virus and Trojan Horse Prevention</h2>
  <ul>
    <p>
    Modern computers are infected with hostile programs (viruses or
    Trojan horses) with disturbing regularity.  What requirements must
    be satisfied to prevent viruses from taking hold?  Can the various
    proection models support these requirements?  model?
  </ul>
  <p>
  <h2>Fault Containment</h2>
  <ul>
    <p>
    ActiveX uses a Authenticode<sup>tm</sup> to authenticate software
    components, but this technology provides no protection against
    (unintentional) flaws or (intentional) attacks.  A properly fault
    contained system would never crash because an erroneous
    application had been installed.
  </ul>
  <h2>Confinement</h2>
  <ul>
    <p>
    Confinement is a step up on Fault Containment.  In the confinement
    scenario, we want to make sure that the component cannot give our
    secrets away to someone else.  For example, a text box control
    should not be able to send credit card numbers to a third party.
  </ul>
  <h2>Collaboration Between Mutually Suspicious Parties</h2>
  <ul>
    <p>
    Mutual suspicion is a twist on confinement.  In this case, the
    user wants to know that the component is confined, and the
    component author wants to know that the user cannot steal and
    examine the code or data used by the component.
  </ul>
  <h2>Multilevel Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <p>
    In 1977, the National Bureau of Standards made the following statement
    in the report from the 1977 workshop on the Audit and Evaluation of
    Computer Systems:
    <blockquote>
      ... The point is that internal control mechanisms of current
      operating systems have too low integrity for them to... effectively
      isolate a user on the system from data that is at a `higher'
      security than he is trusted... to deal with.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    Multilevel security systems are designed to solve this problem.
    In a multilevel security system, a user must be of sufficient
    authority to gain access to documents.  The main problem is
    ensuring that such a user does not transmit those documents to
    someone at a lower authority level.  While a few such systems have
    been completed, neither the systems themselves nor the ideas they
    embody have seen widespread use.

<H1>Solutions to Date</H1>
<p>
<ul>
  <h2>Confinement</h2>
  <ul>
    <p>
    Work by Jonathan Shapiro and Sam Weber at the University of
    Pennsylvania has proven mathematically that capability systems can
    support confinement.  The paper, entitled <a
    href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~shap/EROS/popl98.300dpi.ps">Verifying
    Operating System Security</a> is available online.  We are working
    on making this proof available in commentable form.
  </ul>
  <p>
  Got another solution?  Link it to the words <em>another protection
  solution</em> and we'll add it.

<h1>About the Fact Forum</h1>
<P>
The Foresight <A
HREF="http://www.foresight.org/EOC/EOC_Chapter_13.html">Fact Forum</A>
was inspired by the Science Court concept, originated by Prof.  Arthur
Kantrowitz, an advisor to Foresight Institute now at Dartmouth
College, combined with hypertext publishing concepts from Ted Nelson,
Doug Engelbart, Eric Drexler, and others.
<P>
Foresight Institute considers the building of reliable, secure
software to be essential in a world of increasingly-ubiquitous
computing. For more on Foresight Institute and how we are preparing
