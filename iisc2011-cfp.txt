Dear All,

A call for papers has been issued for the ISSA Ireland Security Conference
(IISC) 2011 being held on 11th and 12th of May 2011 in The Royal College of
Physicians Ireland on Kildare Street, Dublin.

The conference will focus on a wide range of topics, from Technical and
Operational Security to Management and Governance of Information Security
along with discussions on future threats and trends. We are looking for
something different so if you feel your talk is a bit off the wall, by all
means submit it. For more information please see

Best Regards,
ISSA Ireland
