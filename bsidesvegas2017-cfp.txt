https://bsideslv.org/openconf/openconf.php.

We're accepting proposals for the following tracks:

Breaking Ground a Ground Breaking Information Security research and
conversations on the aNext Big Thinga. Interactively discussing your
research with our participants and getting feedback, input and opinion. No
preaching from the podium at a passive audience.

Common Ground a Other topics of interest to the security community. e.g.,
Lock-picking, hardware hacking, mental health/burnout, Law, Privacy,
Regulations, Risk, Crypto, Activism, etc. Again, interactive discussions
with your peers and fellow researchers. Not passive lectures aata an
audience.

Underground a OTR talks on subjects best discussed AFK. No press, no
recording, no streaming, no names. Just you and your peers, discussing what
matters, behind closed doors. Think about it.

Ground Truth a  Focused on innovative computer science and mathematics
applied to security. Topics of interest include machine learning, natural
language processing, Big Data technologies, cryptography, compression, data
structures, zero knowledge proofs or just about anything academically
publishable that usually baffles review committees for other conferences.

I Am The Cavalry a  Security that affects public safety and human life.
Where our domain overlaps others, we must gather teammates and forge an
alliance. Technical discussions cover medical devices, cars, and other
connected technologies with a higher consequence of failure. Non-technical
talks cover issues where security overlaps with the human condition, and
building skills to influence change outside the echo chamber. See
Iamthecavalry.org or @iamthecavalry for more information.

PasswordsLV a Focused on the (in)security of passwords and other
authentication solutions, bringing together security researchers, password
crackers, and experts in password security from around the globe in order
to better understand and address the challenges surrounding digital
authentication. This track explores all facets of authentication security,
from analysis and education to creating, securing, cracking, and exploiting
authentication solutions. See passwordscon.org for more information.

Training Ground a  consists of workshops and classes to give your students
hands-on experience learning the latest and greatest. We accept proposals
for 1/2 day, full-day and 2-day workshops.

Proving Ground a Mentorship and Scholarship track for first time national
speakers. Get paired with a great mentor, who will help you with your
presentation from CFP to podium AND receive up to $500 to help offset the
costs of traveling to Vegas to present.

Hire Ground a   Our career track: Mock Interviews, Open Resume Review,
