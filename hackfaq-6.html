<H2><A NAME="miscinfo"></A> <A NAME="s6">6. Misc Info</A></H2>

<P>This section contains miscellaneous information regarding hacking basics.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="backdoor"></A> <A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 What is a "backdoor"?</A>
</H2>

<P>A backdoor is simply a way back into a system that not only bypasses existing
security to regain access, but may even defeat any additional security enhancements
added onto a system.
<P>Backdoors can range from the simple to the exotic. Simple backdoors might include
creating a new user account just for your intrusion needs, or taking over a little-used
account. More complex backdoors may bypass regular access completely and involve
trojans, such as a login program that gives you administrative access if you type in
a special password.
<P>Backdoors can be chained together, which is the technique used by most hackers. This
involves a combination of techniques. For example, one or more accounts that have 
basic user access may have had their passwords cracked, and one or more accounts may
be created by the hacker. Once the system is accessed by the hacker, the hacker 
may activate some technique or exploit a system misconfiguration that allows greater
access. Often a hacker will lower the defenses in certain areas by slightly altering
system configuration files. Perhaps a trojan program has been installed that will
open holes upon command by the hacker. Some of these techniques will be discussed
in detail in the individual operating system sections of this FAQ.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Why do I care about auditing, accounting, and logging?</A>
</H2>

<P>Auditing, accounting, logging -- call it what you will, these are things used to
create permanent or semi-permanent records of events on a system. Unfortunately these
can record your intrusion activities, sometimes in explicit and evidence-worthy detail.
Therefore potential intruders should not only be aware of what record keeping is
available (either as a regular feature of the system or as add-ons) and have possible
methods for defeating such recordings.
<P>Some types of logging include simple text files with entries showing logins and
logouts, maybe failed logins. Others show what programs were accessed, which programs
were attempted to be run and the request failed, or keep track of an individual's
disk usage. All can reveil info that can allow an administrator to reconstruct an
attack.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 What are some different logging techniques used by Admins?</A>
</H2>

<P>Admins generally prefer to use simple logging techniques so as not to pile onto their 
current workload. Logs take up space. Large log files are sometimes very difficult
to sift through as sys admins are looking for problems. These logs are usually stored 
in directories generally protected from casual viewing, or at least editing.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Why should I not just delete the log files?</A>
</H2>

<P>Typically log files do not disappear. This might lead a curious sys admin to poke around
looking for problems, and the paranoid sys admin to look for intruders. The logs should
be edited if possible, or the entries made into them made to look as normal as
possible.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 What is a buffer overflow?</A>
</H2>

<P>A buffer overflow is when a buffer was assigned by a programmer to hold variable data,
and the variable data placed into that buffer is greater that the size of the initial
assignment of the buffer. Depending on the operating system and exactly what the "extra"
data overflowing the buffer is, this can be used by a hacker to cause portions of a system
to fail, or even execute arbitrary code.
<P>Most buffer overflow exploits center around user-supplied data exceeding a buffer, and the
extra data being executed on the stack to open up additional access. Buffer overflows exist
on all major network operating systems.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 What's the story with WinGate?</A>
</H2>

<P>While not exactly a Windows NT-only issue, it seriously affects Windows 95
users as many have installed this product. WinGate is a product that allows
IP masquerading through a single Windows 95/98/NT box onto the Internet.
WinGate comes in three flavors -- WinGate Home, Wingate Standard, and
WinGate Pro. It is so popular for home users because with a few points
and clicks the entire home network can be talking to the Internet through
a single PC that has a modem attached. The home version is also around $40
for 3 users, making it very cheap.
<P>Older versions are still around, including WinGate Lite, which are free.
Older versions are also subject to denial of service. Telnetting repeatedly
to localhost from a WinGate will crash it as it eventually runs out of
resources. Connecting to port 2080 and dumping in about 2K of junk will
crash WinGate.
<P>Pointing your web browser to a WinGate machine via port 8010 will either
give you the error message of "connection cannot be established" or you will
be returned a list of files on the target system. Ouch. Here's an example:
<P>
<PRE>

&lt;http://www.server.com:8010/c:/> &lt;-- NT/Win9x
&lt;http://www.server.com:8010//> &lt;-- NT/Win9x
&lt;http://www.server.com:8010/..../> &lt;-- Win9x
</PRE>
<P>Attackers and spammers will use improperly configured WinGates (read default
settings) to bounce through and hide their real source location.
<P>For those of you actually using WinGate, I recommend using a cheap old 386
with 8MB RAM, an 80MB hard drive, and a free Unix flavor loaded up instead.
You can probably find someone to *give* you the hardware, you can configure
it a lot safer than WinGate, and it's a little more cool. However if you
must use WinGate be sure to go into the Gatekeeper program, and adjust the
policies so that "Everyone" can only access from localhost and internal
machines.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7 How do I find these buggy WinGates I can use?</A>
</H2>

<P>Go to Altavista and do a search for "wingate scanner". This should point
you in the right direction. As this is a popular bounce point of an
attack for IRC script kids, especially those trying to hide their true
identity and location, I recommend serious virus scanning of anything you
download in compiled form.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.8">6.8 What's with ICQ?</A>
</H2>

<P>If someone has turned on the "Activate my home page" feature it will turn
their computer into a poor web server. Telnet to port 80 and type junk,
followed by quit and enter. Boom, GPF. You can also explore the person's
hard drive. Here's how:
<P>
<PRE>

&lt;http://members.icq.com/>&lt;ICQ of target person>
</PRE>
<P>This will redirect you to the person's home computer and you'll have
their IP address.
<P>
<PRE>

http://&lt;IP address>/...../a2.html
</PRE>
<P>This will show you the a2.html file in the ICQ directory. Add more dots
and add .html to the url to look at other files.
<P>This works on ICQ99a build 1700. The fix? Don't use ICQ, it's lame anyway.
