II. Fake E-mail
     (Fooling UUCP)

HOW DO I MAKE FAKE MAIL (OR HOW DO I FOOL UUCP)?
(from Beelzebub, Doktor Nil w/ Belisarius)

1.  Telnet to port 25 of any internet server
       (eg. telnet site.name.and.address 25)
2.  If at all possible, AVOID TYPING "HELO".
3.  Type: rcpt to (person to receive fake mail){ENTER}
4.  Type: mail from (fake name and address){ENTER}
5.  The mail server should ok each time after each name.
6.  If it does not:
     a) type vrfy and then the name of the person
     b) as a last resort use helo, this will login your computer as
        having been the source of the mail
7.  Retype the commands, it should say ok now.
8.  Type: data{ENTER}
9.  The first line of the message will be the Subject line
10.  Enter your letter
11.  To send letter type a "." on an empty line.
12. Then type quit{ENTER}
13. This is traceable by any sysadmin ... don't harass people this
    way.
14. If the person receiving the mail uses a shell like elm he/she
    will not see the telltale fake message warning
    "Apparently-To:(name)" even if not, most people wouldn't know
    what it means anyway.
15. Make sure you use a four part address somebody@part1.pt2.pt3.pt4
    so as to make it look more believable and cover any add-ons the
    mail routine might try
16. Put a realistic mail header in the mail message to throw people
    off even more.  If there are To: and Date: lines then the
    program probably won't add them on.
17. Also try to telnet to the site where the recipient has his
    account.  This works better if you know how to fool it.
