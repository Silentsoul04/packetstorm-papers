<TD NAME="3"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="3">Station Level Rating - The "06" digit pair is used when the customer has subscribed to a class of service in order to be provided with real time billing information.  For example, hotel/motels, served by PBXs, receive detailed billing information, including the calling party’s room number.  When the originating switching system does not receive the detailed billing information, e.g., room number, this "06" code allows the call to be routed to an operator or operator services system to obtain complete billing information.  The rating and/or billing information is then provided to the service subscriber.  This code is used only when the directory number (DN) is not accompanied by an automatic room/account identification.</SPAN></TD>

<TD NAME="3"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="3">Coin or Non-Coin - on calls using database access, e.g., 800, ANI II 23 is used to indicate that the coin/non-coin status of the originating line cannot be positively distinguished for ANI purposes by the SSP.  The ANI II pair 23 is substituted for the II pairs which would otherwise indicate that the non-coin status is known, i.e., 00, or when there is ANI failure.<P>

ANI II 23 may be substituted for a valid 2-digit ANI pair on 0-800 calls.  In all other cases, ANI II 23 should not be substituted for a valid 2-digit ANI II pair which is forward to an SSP from an EAEO.<P>

Thus, Code 24  indicates that this is a toll free service call since that fact can no longer be recognized simply by examining the called address.</SPAN></TD>

A confinement/detention facility may be defined as including, but not limited to, Federal, State and/or Local prisons, juvenile facilities, immigration and naturalization confinement/detention facilities, etc., which are under the administration of Federal, State, City, County, or other Governmental agencies.  Prison/Inmate Service lines will be identified by the customer requesting such call screening and restriction.  In those cases where private paystations are located in confinement/detention facilities, and the same call restrictions applicable to Prison/Inmate Service required, the ANI II digit for Prison/Inmate Service will apply if the line is identified for Prison/Inmate Service by the customer.</SPAN></TD>
