IMPORTANT: Due to the highly technical subject of the congress, and the preferences shown by attendees
in multiple surveys, we encourage potential sponsors who intend to have a slot as speaker attempting to adapt as far as possible to the tastes of most
RootedCON asset you have: its audience.

Any help, comments, ideas, suggestions or collaborations that we should do get will be considered and
valued with all its importance: it is very important for the Congress to receive such proposals, and
they depend on you to organize the best event possible.



-=] Critical points to consider

1. Time management and the duration of the talks are one of the
critical points in the Congress. Rather, they should ask for a longer talk
than trying to rush twenty minutes, without allowing time for audience questions.

2. It will be appreciated EXCLUSIVE talks, which
not previously published in any other forum, blog, website, event or conference.

3. We believe in the responsible Full-disclosure so, if the idea is to present a
Zero-Day, we want confirmation from that has contacted the manufacturer / victim, if this
contact has not been made, we offer to manage the contact.

4. A cause for termination of the relationship between the Speaker and RootedCON is to not deliver
of (every) material on the date indicated.

5. PLEASE, it's very important to * CLEARLY * indicate if accommodation and
travel is needed or not when you submit your proposal, Rooted
reserves the right not to meet such needs if it is not initially requested.
