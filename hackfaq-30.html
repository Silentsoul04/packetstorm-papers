<P>This section contains info regarding logging for Unix.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss30.1">30.1 Where are the common log files in Unix?</A>
</H2>

<P>Log files for Unix vary from flavor to flavor. But there are a few guidelines as to
where these logs are kept.
<P>System log files and accounting files are in /var/adm, /var/log, or sometimes /usr/adm. 
Common log files include <CODE>messages</CODE>, <CODE>syslog</CODE>, and on some systems <CODE>sulog</CODE>.
Checking <CODE>/etc/defaults</CODE> and <CODE>/etc/syslog.conf</CODE> may reveil more. Also <CODE>wtmp</CODE>,
<CODE>utmp</CODE>, and <CODE>lastlog</CODE> will contain information regarding logins.
<P>The most important one will probably be syslog. Most utilities, including security add-on
programs can write to syslog, so it make a handy location for dumping info. But bear in mind
that there are a lot of processes that might log to separate log files. Here are some
potential files to look for:
<P>
<PRE>
File                 Purpose
-------------------  ---------------------------------------
/var/spool/cron/log  Cron log file
/var/log/maillog     Logs inbound and outbound mail activity
/var/spool/lp/log    Log file for printing
</PRE>
<P>There are more, but this should give you an idea.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss30.2">30.2 How do I edit/change the log files for Unix?</A>
</H2>

<P>Most of these files are text files and can be easily edited, assuming you have the
permission to do so. But some of these files require you to write special tools to
edit them, mainly the <CODE>utmp</CODE>, <CODE>wtmp</CODE>, and possibly <CODE>lastlog</CODE>.
A good "universal" editor (meaning it will run on most Unix systems) can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.nmrc.org/files/unix/remove.c">http://www.nmrc.org/files/unix/remove.c</A>. It will allow you to selectively remove
entries from these files.
