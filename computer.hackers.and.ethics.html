                          Computer Hacking and Ethics

   [A slightly different version of this paper was written for the
   ``Panel on Hacking'' held by the Association for Computing Machinery
   in April, 1985. Thanks to Batya Friedman, Donn Parker, and Carter
   Sanders for their comments on early drafts.]
   
     [Neal Patrick] said he and his friends, who named themselves the
     ``414s'' after the Milwaukee area code, did not intend to do any
     damage and did not realize they were doing anything unethical or
     illegal. In fact, when asked [at a Congressional subcommittee
     hearing] at what point he questioned the ethics of his actions, he
     answered, ``Once the FBI knocked on the door.''
     
     -- "`Common Sense' Urged on Computer Break-Ins," 26 Sept 83;

   It's no secret that a mature sense of ethics is something a person
   develops over time. Parents are supposed to exercise authority over
   their children because the children are not expected to know how to
   make certain decisions for themselves. We have a juvenile court system
   separate from the adult criminal court system because we believe that
   a young person is not capable of criminal intent in the same sense
   that an adult is capable of it.
   
   Within this century, the obvious idea that the ethical sense of an
   adolescent isn't the same as that of an adult has become the focus of
   scientific research. Psychologists have entered a field once left to
   philosophers: moral development. The best-known attempt to formalize
   this development is probably the six-stage theory of Harvard
   psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg. Here is his description of Stage 3,
   the Interpersonal Concordance or ``Good Boy-Nice Girl'' Orientation:
   
     Good behavior is that which pleases or helps others and is approved
     by them. There is much conformity to stereotypical images of what
     is majority or ``natural'' behavior. Behavior is frequently judged
     by intention--the judgment ``he means well'' becomes important for
     the first time. One earns approval by being ``nice.'' [Kohlberg, p.
     18]
     
   Is Neal Patrick at this third stage of moral development? He seems to
   judge his own actions in terms of intention. From the perspective of
   the stage theory, we can see this as an improvement over ``Our mistake
   was to get caught'' or ``What have those computer companies done for
   me,'' responses that would be typical of the earlier stages.
   
   I don't mean to give too much weight to the specifics of the third
   stage. It's not scientifically valid to assign Patrick to a
   developmental stage on the basis of one quoted sentence. Also, not
   every researcher accepts Kohlberg's stages. But the important point is
   that Patrick is roughly at the stage of moral development appropriate
   to his age. He is not some new kind of monster spawned by computer
   technology; he's a kid with all the strengths and weaknesses we expect
   from kids in other situations.
   
   Compare a bunch of adolescents breaking into a computer system with
   another bunch of kids hot-wiring a car for a joyride. The latter would
   probably argue, with complete sincerity, that they were doing no harm,
   because the owner of the car recovered his property afterward. They
   didn't keep or sell it. It's a ``naughty'' prank to borrow someone's
   property in that way, but not really serious.
   
   These hypothetical car thieves would be wrong, of course, in making
   that argument. They might lack the sensitivity needed to give weight
   to the victim's feelings of manipulation, of fear, of anger. They may
   not understand how the experience of such a random attack can leave a
   person feeling a profound loss of order and safety in the world--the
   feeling that leads half our population to hail Bernhard Goetz as a
   hero to be emulated. Some adolescents don't have the empathy to see
   beyond the issue of loss of property. Some may show empathy in certain
   situations but not in others.
   
   The point is that the computer raises no new issue, ethical or
   pragmatic. The password hacker who says ``we aren't hurting anything
   by looking around'' is exactly analogous to the joyrider saying ``we
   aren't stealing the car permanently.''
   
   (The two cases need not seem analogous to an adolescent. There may be
   many computer abusers who would never break into a car for a joyride,
   but who don't understand that breaking into a computer account raises
   the same ethical issues. But the analogy still holds for us as
   adults.)
   
   The professional car thief and the teenaged joyrider are both social
   problems, but they're different problems. To confuse the two--to treat
   the teenager like a career criminal--would be a disastrously
   self-fulfilling prophecy.
   
   In the context of computer systems, there is a similar dichotomy.
   There are some career criminals who steal by electronic means. This
   small group poses a large problem for society, but it's not a new one.
   Thieves are thieves. Just as banks use special armored cars, they must
   also develop special armored computer systems. But the rest of us
   don't use armored cars for routine transportation, and we don't need
   armored computer systems for routine communication either. (Of course
   there is a large middle ground between heavy security and no security
   at all. My purpose here is not to decide exactly what security
   measures are appropriate for any particular computer system. Instead,
   I just want to make it clear that, while in this paper I'm not trying
   to address the problem of professional criminals, I'm not trying to
   deny that there is such a problem either.)
   
   There is also a middle ground between the young person who happens to
   break unimportant rules in the innocent exercise of intellectual
   curiosity and the hardened criminal. Consider the hypothetical case of
   a young man whose girlfriend moves to Australia for a year, and so he
   builds himself a blue box (a device used to place long distance
   telephone calls without paying for them) and uses it to chat with her
   for an hour every other day. This is not intellectual curiosity, nor
   is it a deliberate, long-term choice of a life of crime. Instead, this
   hypothetical adolescent, probably normally honest, has stepped over a
   line without really noticing it, because his mind is focused on
   something else. It would be inappropriate, I think, to pat him on the
   head and tell him how clever he is, and equally inappropriate to throw
   him in prison. What we must do is call his attention to the
   inconsistency between his activities and, most likely, his own moral
   standards.
   
Two Models for Moral Direction

   What to do about it? Saying that the problems of computer ethics are
   like other ethical problems doesn't solve them. Many approaches are
   possible. We are starting to hear among computer experts the same
   debates we've heard for centuries among criminologists: prevention,
   deterrence, retribution, cure?
   
   Among all the possible approaches, it may be instructive to consider
   two strongly opposed ones: first, control of the technology, and
   second, moral training. As examples of these approaches, compare the
   registration of automobiles with instruction in karate.
   
   Automobile registration is certainly a good idea in helping the police
   control professional crime. As thieves have learned to steal cars for
   their parts, rather than to sell whole, the technology of registration
   has had to grow more sophisticated: we now see serial numbers on each
   major component, not just on the door frame. But registration doesn't
   help against joyriders.
   
   Other technological security measures can help. Steering column locks
   have made joyriding harder, but not impossible. Many adolescents are
   expert locksmiths, not because they're dishonest but because locks and
   keys pose a technical challenge much like that of passwords in a
   computer system. Also, increased security has made the consequences of
   juvenile car theft more serious, because the easiest way to defeat a
   steering column lock is to destroy it by brute force.
   
   The example of karate instruction shows a very different approach to
   the problem of adolescent moral limitations. Instead of using
   technology to limit the power of young people, this second approach
   deliberately empowers them. Skill in karate is a deadly weapon; to
   give that weapon to a young person is an affirmation of trust rather
   than suspicion.
   
   Why do karate classes for kids work? Why don't they lead to an
   epidemic of juvenile murders? This paper can't present a definitive
   answer. But I want to suggest some possibilities and use them to draw
   analogies for computer education.
   
   One probable reason is that every person responds to his or her
   situation. If I know you're trusting me with something important, I'll
   try to live up to your trust. If I sense that you consider me
   untrustworthy, I may decide that I might as well live up to your low
   expectations.
   
   Another vital reason, though, is that the technical instruction in
   karate techniques is part of a larger initiation into a certain
   culture and its rules. Karate schools don't begin by telling novices,
   ``Here's how to kill someone.'' They begin with simple, less dangerous
   techniques; the criteria for advancement include control and
   self-discipline as well as knowledge of particular moves. Instructors
   emphasize that karate is an art that should not be abused. Students
   learn to demonstrate punches and kicks without injury by stopping just
   short of contact with the opponent's body.
   
Empowerment in Computer Education

   How can we teach young computer enthusiasts to be responsible members
   of the electronic community, without defining them as criminals? The
   analogy of karate instruction suggests that the answer is to combine
   ethical training with real empowerment. To turn this broad slogan into
   a practical program requires several changes in our approach to
   educational computing and to computing in general.
   
     Growth, like any ongoing function, requires adequate objects in the
     environment to meet the needs and capacities of the growing child,
     boy, youth, and young man, until he can better choose and make his
     own environment. It is not a ``psychological'' question of poor
     influences and bad attitudes, but an objective question of real
     opportunities for worthwhile experience.... Thwarted, or starved,
     in the important objects proper to young capacities, the boys and
     young men naturally find or invent deviant objects for themselves;
     this is the beautiful shaping power of our human nature. Their
     choices and inventions are rarely charming, usually stupid, and
     often disastrous; we cannot expect average kids to deviate with
     genius. [Goodman, pp. 12-13]
     
   Paul Goodman was discussing traditional juvenile delinquents, not
   password hackers. But the problem is fundamentally the same. How can
   we provide a worthwhile culture for young computer enthusiasts to grow
   into?
   
   1. Serious adult models. In karate instruction, discipline is not only
   for novices. The adult instructors follow the same discipline
   themselves. The ethical principles taught to beginners are taken
   seriously in the adult community. As a result, young students don't
   see the discipline of karate as an arbitrary imposition on them; they
   see it as part of what it means to be a full member of the community.
   
   In the computer culture, adults rarely take seriously the idea of
   belonging to a community. The social ideal is the self-serving
   entrepreneur. Our heros are the ones who become millionaires by doing
   a slick marketing job on yet another spreadsheet program. (When my
   high school programming students discovered that I actually knew how
   to program a computer, many of them decided I was crazy. Why should
   anyone want to teach when he could make more money programming?) In
   this context, why should any young person listen to our moral
   lecturing?
   
   Fundamentally what is needed is personal action by each individual
   computer professional. But we can act as a society to encourage this
   individual commitment. We can urge our colleagues to devote part of
   their time to pro bono publico activities, like other professionals.
   We can give special public recognition to computer professionals who
   choose a life of disinterested public service over the quest for
   personal gain. Some corporations allow their employees paid sabbatical
   leave for public service work; we should encourage this policy.
   
   2. Access to real power. Another important part of the karate analogy
   is that there are not two kinds of karate, one for adults and one for
   kids. What beginners learn may be elementary, but it's a start down
   the same road traveled by experts. The community into which young
   karate students are welcomed is the real, adult community. That's not
   how things work with computers. How many adult computer scientists put
   up with CP/M, BASIC, and floppy disks? The technology available to
   most young people is not a simpler version of what experts use; it's a
   completely separate, more arcane, fundamentally less powerful medium.
   That medium--the programming languages, the file storage, the editing
   tools, and so on--is simply inadequate to challenging intellectual
   work.
   
   The community of computer professionals has come to take for granted
   easy access to electronic communication with colleagues anywhere in
   the world. Those of us lucky enough to be on the Arpanet have
   instantaneous communication supported by taxpayers. Even the less
   fortunate who communicate over dialup networks like uucp, though, have
   the cost of their mail supported by computing facilities other than
   their own; the general agreement among even competing private
   businesses to forward one another's mail is a remarkable example of
   disinterested cooperation. Some of this mail traffic is serious
   business. But some of it is also ``junk mail'' like sf-lovers (for
   science fiction enthusiasts) and human-nets. Is it surprising that
   young computer enthusiasts want a slice of the pie too?
   
   Adolescents are excluded not only from access to equipment but also
   from access to ideas. The password hackers' preoccupation with magic
   words and magic numbers is harmful to themselves as well as to the
   rest of us; it's an intellectual dead end that gives them no real
   insight into computer science. They learn a bag of isolated tricks
   rather than powerful ideas that extend to solving other kinds of
   problems. Instead of just telling them what's forbidden, we would do
   better to show them the path to our own understanding of algorithms,
   formal theory of computation, and so on. We all know you can't program
   well in BASIC; why do we allow manufacturers to inflict it on
   children?
   
   To take positive steps toward this goal requires action on two fronts,
   access to technology and access to ideas. The latter requires training
   high school teachers who are themselves qualified computer
   programmers. In the long run, this means paying teachers salaries
   competitive with industry standards. That's a matter for government
   action. Another approach may be to promote active cooperation between
   university computer science departments and high schools. Perhaps
   college faculty and graduate students could contribute some of their
   time to the local high schools. (This is not a new idea; outside
   experts are donating time to secondary schools to help teach other
   areas of science. Such partnership brings its own problems, because
   both the goals and the techniques of college teaching are different
   from those of high school teaching. Still, this collaboration has
   sometimes been fruitful.)
   
   The problem of access to equipment is economically more difficult, but
   it's getting easier. The availability of 32-bit microprocessors means
   that serious computational power should be affordable in the near
   future. Equipment manufacturers should take the high school market
   seriously, as an investment in future technical workers. Another
   approach is for interested educators to establish regional computing
   centers for adolescents, not part of a particular school, where kids
   can come on their own time. Economies of scale may allow such centers
   to provide state-of-the-art equipment that a single high school
   couldn't justify economically.
   
   3. Apprenticeship: challenging problems and access to expertise. The
   karate student is given not only access to a body of knowledge, but
   also the personal attention of a master in the field. The instructor
   is responsible for the moral development of his students as well as
   their technical skill. He steers them in the direction of challenges
   appropriate to each one's progress, and his own expertise is available
   to help the learner.
   
   For many years, the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ran a
   computer system with no passwords and no file protection at all. (It
   was pressure from their Defense Department funding agency, not
   internal needs, that forced them to implement a password scheme.) Even
   now, the laboratory has a liberal ``tourist'' policy: anyone can have
   an account, provided that someone at the laboratory is willing to be
   his or her mentor. The philosophy behind this policy is that most
   ``malicious'' computer abuse is the result of ignorance,
   misunderstanding, and thoughtlessness, rather than truly malign
   intent. With a particular person responsible for each new user,
   tourists learn to share the values of the community. They are taught
   that the vulnerability of MIT's system is a price researchers pay
   willingly for the open exchange of information that that vulnerability
   allows. Treated as legitimate members of the community, even young
   tourists quickly learn to act responsibly toward the group.
   
   Not every computer facility can be expected to share the vision of
   MIT-AI. Certainly the computers that control the missiles and the
   banking transactions should not be so open to visitors. But a typical
   large company has several computers, not all equally sensitive. Many
   could allow access to young people in their communities in the
   evenings, especially if some of their professional staff members are
   interested in serving as volunteer mentors. It's the mentor/apprentice
   relationship that makes all the difference. Just giving a kid an
   account on your machine may be asking for trouble, but making a friend
   of the kid is a good investment.
   
   In particular, universities often treat their undergraduate student
   users like irresponsible children. Undergraduates are generally
   second-class citizens, with limited access to the school's computing
   resources, including human resources (faculty). Universities should
   allow undergraduates to function as true members of serious research
   teams, as graduate students do. This policy would provide both access
   to faculty mentors and challenging, useful tasks.
   
   For secondary schools, the issue is partly one of curriculum. Too many
   teenagers are taught (not only in the schools but also in the
   magazines) that true computer expertise means knowing what number to
   POKE into what address in order to change the color of the screen on
   some brand of microcomputer. Such learning is not intellectually
   challenging. It does not lead to a feeling of fruitful apprenticeship.
   
   4. A safe arena for moral experimentation. The beginning karate
   student might be afraid to try his or her skill with a fellow student,
   lest he or she injure or be injured. But it's safe to fight a match
   with a black belt instructor. ``I won't hurt you,'' says the
   instructor, ``and I won't let you hurt me.'' To allow for safe
   sparring between students, classes begin with half-speed motions and
   no body contact allowed. Later they may progress to rules that allow
   light body contact but no contact to the opponent's head. These rules
   allow students to feel safe as they experiment and develop their
   skills.
   
   Young people have a similar need for safety in moral experimentation.
   One of the reasons for the appeal of role-playing games like Dungeons
   and Dragons is that a player can say ``I'm going to be a thief,'' or
   ``I'm going to be evil,'' trying on these roles without actually
   harming anyone. Similarly, a good school should be a place where
   students feel safe, a kind of ``ethics laboratory.''
   
   Neal Patrick's first exposure to an ethical dilemma should not have
   involved the FBI. He should have confronted the issue of information
   privacy while using a computer system in his school. He could have
   learned how his antisocial acts hurt and angered the legitimate users
   of the system, without risking really serious trouble for himself or
   for anyone else. For one thing, it's hard for a young person to
   understand the chain of reasoning from the abstract corporate owner of
   a computer system to the actual human beings whose lives are affected
   when that system breaks down. It's easier to understand the issues
   when the users are one's friends and classmates, and the social
   effects of malicious password hacking are immediately apparent.
   
   (None of this is meant to excuse Patrick or the other 414s. Neither
   ignorance of the law nor misunderstanding the ethical issues is
   accepted in our culture as an excuse for lawbreaking. But I am not
   writing for a court of law meeting to settle Patrick's guilt or
   innocence. The question for us is how, as a society, we can act to
   make the next generation of teenagers less likely to paint themselves
   into this particular corner.)
   
   As a practical matter, what's needed to build an ethics laboratory for
   computing students has already been recommended in another context:
   adequate computing power to support a user community, as opposed to a
   bunch of isolated, independent microcomputer users. Whether this means
   timesharing or a network of personal computers with a shared file
   server is a technical question beyond the scope of this paper. But
   sharing is essential. The ethical issues of a living community don't
   arise in the context of isolated individuals using microcomputers
   separately with no communication among them. (If we do not fill this
   need, we leave a void that in practice is filled by ``pirate''
   bulletin boards that build a sort of outlaw community around illegal
   computing activities.)
