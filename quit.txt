	Due to recent events, the downfall of g0at security has become imminent. 

	These incidents include:

- Legal problems of some of our members.
- Recent hacking crack downs launched by many governments.
- The recent takeover of our channel, #feed-the-goats (Efnet).
- Losing our server due to a sloppy hack by one of our members (/me looks away).
- Losing our text files due to our domain being wiped off the server.
- Fights and dissapearances of some of our members.
- The maturing of our members.

	g0at security hereby announces it's closure. By this we do not mean we are going legit, we are finished. Unlike other groups we most likely will not spawn back.

[Brief history of g0at security]

	One day in Feb. I believe, ech0 and myself (Debris), decided to irc. ech0 informed me that occasionally hung out in a channel he, himself created called #feed-the-goats. From there, members of a popular group, HcV along with members of Global Hell, began coming. ech0 and myself decided that we wanted to be as elite as our peers in #rootworm, so we made a webpage. The purpose of the page was to mock and satirize hacker culture in general. Our first document entitled "g0at declares war on LoU" mocked the Legion of the Underground's new attempt at becoming legit among a handful of other aspects of their organization.
	Our original url (goat.sphix.com) quickly grew in size and popularity, and our channel became more populated. The hacks began soon after, some by members and a lot by non-members. g0at's highpoint came soon after the controversial yahoo hack. Our popularity skyrocketted and the name g0at became known to all (unfortunatly we got all the l33t0s in our channel and wouldn't go away). The fun and games continued up until April, when all the 'incidents' began. Then May was the last straw.

[Where do we go from here]

	Most members will most likely go their own ways. Many still hang in #feed-the-goatz (our new channel). No more text releases will come from g0at, our webpage will remain down, our archive on attrition.org will stay the same and nothing will be heard of us as a group.

[Thanks and greets]

	Thanks to all that supported our group and enjoyed the text we wrote to amuse the unintelligent. Greets to all our 12 members, HNN, attrition, net-security, HWA.hax0r.news. JP, for entertaining us for hours with your hacker journalism. And thanks to all the rest.


Finally.... it's been fun. It's been awesome being associated with g0at.

You can still reach us at g0at@attrition.org for further questions or comments or whatever (I just want email)
