		         INTRODUCTION TO THE
		       DEGAUSSER PRODUCTS LIST


	The Degausser Products List (DPL) lists the model identification of
equipment units that were evaluated against and found to satisfy the
requirements for erasure of magnetic media that hold classified data.  A
commercial production unit of each model of degausser was evaluated against
Department of Defense (DOD) requirements for erasure of classified tapes as
set forth in DoD Manual 5200.28-M, "Techniques and Procedures for
Implementing, Deactivating, Testing, and Evaluating Secure Resource-Sharing
ADP Systems," dated January 1973, Section VIII, Specifications For Magnetic
Tape Erase Equipment.  The National Security Agency/Central Security Services
(NSA/CSS) has implemented the Manual's specification in NSA/CSS Specification
L14-4, dated 31 October 1987.  Listing of a product on the DPL does not
constitute endorsement of the product by the government or NSA, it merely
indicates that the unit evaluated has met all applicable degausser
requirements.  Moreover, though listed in the DPL, products must be
periodically tested to ensure continued compliance with the specification.
NSA/CSS Specification L14-4, Section 5, Degaussing Level Performance Test
Procedures, gives a test procedure that users may follow to verify continued
compliance with the specification.

	Magnetic media are divided into types.  Type I products are used to
degauss magnetic media whose coercivity is no greater than 350 Oersteds (Oe).
Type II products are used to degauss magnetic media whose coercivity is no
greater than 750 Oe.  Coercivity of a magnetic media defines the magnetic
field necessary to reduce a magnetically-saturated material's magnetization to
zero.  The correct use of degaussing products will ensure that classified data
is no longer retrievable.  NOTE: IN ADDITION TO DEGAUSSING, CERTAIN
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES MAY BE REQUIRED BEFORE DEGAUSSED MAGNETIC MEDIA MAY
BE DECLASSIFIED.  CONSULT YOUR SECURITY OFFICER OR MANAGER FOR GUIDANCE IN
THIS REGARD.

	Correct use of these equipments is necessary to ensure inadvertent
disclosure of classified information does not occur.  Accordingly, users
having operational questions about the equipment should direct their questions
to the manufacturer.  Questions regarding security requirements should be
addressed to your Security Officer or manager.

	2.  Production of this model has been discontinued.  Existing models
under this note are still acceptable for use.

	3.  When using this model for tape reels wider than 1/2 inch, the
tape must be turned over and degaussed a second time.


3.  PERMANENT MAGNET DEGAUSSERS


3.1 Hand-held Degaussers - These are hand-held permanent magnets that have
satisfied the requirements to degauss Type I magnetic recording media.  Floppy
disks, disk packs, disk platters, magnetic drum surfaces, bubble memory chips,
and thin film memory modules may be degaussed with these degaussers.

	To degauss disk packs, cover the hand-held magnet with a lintless
tissue, wiping cloth, or layer of thin plastic as a means of preventing damage
to the recording surface.  Insert the degaussing wand into the disk pack so
that the active magnetic portion completely covers the recording surface of
the disk from hub to perimeter.  Wipe each active disk surface (top and
bottom) at least three times with the magnet.
