VIII. Screwing with the most secure operating system on the net
     (VAX/VMS Hacking)

WHAT IS VAX/VMS?

VAX: Virtual Address eXtension.  Computer is desisgned to use memory
     addresses beyond the actual hardware and can therefore run progs
     larger than physical memory.  Developed by Digital Equipment
     Corporation (DEC).

VMS: Virtual Memory System.  Also developed by DEC.

DCL: Digital Command Language.  Similar to DOS batch language or
     UNIX script language.
