What is combing?<br>
Combing is a very effective search strategy: instead of simply searching, you use various other net resources:<br>
</i><pre>
<b><font color="green">-</font></b>The continuously updated &quot;Top 100&quot; or &quot;Top 1000&quot; URL-locations<br>
<b><font color="green">-</font></b>Usenet newsgroups and their various &quot;vigilant filters&quot; and &quot;short range queries&quot;<br>
<b><font color="green">-</font></b>Relevant site links pages.<br>
</pre><i>
Obviously combing is an important technique for whatever interest you may have, quite 
useful in order to spare an incredible lot of Internet searching hours.
<br>
We'll use it here to wage battle against our &quot;commercial smut&quot; enemies, but you would be well advised 
to learn it and use it for *any* interest you may have...<br>

Warning: you better set the option &quot;autoload images&quot; OFF inside your Netscape 
settings, else you'll pretty soon regret having accessed this kind of sites... 
you will not loose anything... NONE of the images they carry is worth loading... 
should you really want nice &quot;sexually explicit&quot; images (for free of course, and 
please excuse the 
pathetic euphemism), then visit the many artists that 
expose their own work on the net... on the sites we are going to destroy 
(see how in the <img SRC="bulletr.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13"><a href="ideale3.htm">CGI-reverse engineering</a> page) you'll not even find any &quot;pornography&quot; whatsoever, only fetid smut.<br>
</font></font></center>
<br><i>
Let's start with a typical &quot;combing&quot; approach, I will not hyperlink because 
I do not want this site spidered along these links, but you may cut and 
paste the following URLs:</i>
<pre><font size="+2">Top1000 counter</font>
http://www.hitbox.com/wc/world2.html          ;TOP1000 &quot;normal&quot;, example for useful combing
http://www.hitbox.com/wc/adult.html           ;TOP1000 &quot;adult&quot;, main entrance
http://www.hitbox.com/wc/top10.adult.html     ;top 10 smut commercial
http://www.hitbox.com/wc/top2100.adult.html   ;top &gt; 2100... understand the &quot;name&quot; 
                                              ;approach
<center><br><hr size="2" width="55%"><br></center>
<font size="+2">Webcounter</font>
http://www.digits.com/top/both_adult_100.html ;top site has here &quot;only&quot; 540000 a day
http://www.digits.com/top/comm_adult_100.html ;top site has here &quot;only&quot; 124000 a day
<center><br><hr size="2" width="55%"><br></center>
Etcetera... you understand the trick now... here are some other ones
<font size="+2">various smut counters</font>:

http://www.xxxcounter.com/home/ 
http://www.web21.com/
http://www.sexhound.com/index.cgi?from=16818			this one uses CGI! :-)
<br></pre><i>
I do not want this page catalogued inside the smut information retrievers, therefore 
the above links are not hyperlinked... cut and paste them in order to use them.<br>
<br></i><pre>
For combing purposes you may also use:
1) the usual search engines (which give incredible results at time!)
2) ftp search, looking for &quot;hidden&quot; subdirectories with relevant names
3) the &quot;big page provider&quot; search engines (like the ones on geocities or mygale)
</pre>
<hr size="2" width="55%">
As you can see from the above short information,<br>
1.1) many &quot;counters' statistics&quot; betray quite a lot of useful information... if, for 
instance, 
you are interested in jellyfishes (it's an example!) you would be well advised, 
instead of searching the web for ages, to have a quick look at all the pages that 
inside the counters' statistics, fall under the counter's main categories <font color="purple">&quot;biology&quot;</font> or <font color="purple">&quot;science&quot;</font>... pretty soon 
you would find the &quot;golden link&quot; you were looking for...<br>
1.2) We need MANY addresses of SMUT dealers in order to find the 
many that utilise a CGI-script (or other attackpoints) in order to 
know &quot;from which site&quot; they got the query... as you'll see on the 
cgi reverse engineering page of this section, this opens the way to their doom!<br>
2)	As anybody that uses 
<img SRC="bulletr.gif" HEIGHT="13" WIDTH="13" ALT="red"></a><a href="http://ftpsearch.unit.no/ftpsearch">ftp search</a> (&quot;This server is located in 
Trondheim, Norway&quot;)
 already knows, the ftp search approach (that fishes hidden directories) can fish incredible (if tricky to interpret) results.<br>
3)	For other combing purposes (not for smut dealers, of course) you may use also the 
search systems specific to the big free pages providers...have a search at and you'll understand 
what I mean <br><br><font size="+2">
Combing on the Usenet</font><br>
<br>
Usenet combing can work &quot;on the fly&quot; or &quot;regularly&quot; through the &quot;Vigilant&quot; 
 filter at<br><pre>
filter@vigilant.bc.ca</pre>
I'll show you for instance one of my queries:<pre>
FIND how-to-search tutorial manual
		NOT spam
		NOT top position
		NOT advertising
		MAX 8</pre>
Such a query would give you useful information about &quot;searching techniques&quot; on 
the Web, you may of course construct how many queries you like and *register* 
(for free) by the vigilant filter, in order to get 
the results of your usenet queries emailed to you every day or week or 
month.<br><br>
Usenet query can also be done through the two big Usenet &quot;depots&quot;: Dejanews and 
email query, that are explained elsewhere on my site.<br>
Many of the main search engines allow such querying 
too, using the services of either Dejanews or emailquery.
