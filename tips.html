<UL>
<LI>Be professional: You don't want someone to not buy what you're doing. You're trying to create an illusion. You're trying to be believable.</li>
<P>
<li>Be calm: look like you belong there.</li>
<p>
<li>Know your mark: Know your enemy. Know exactly how they will react before they do.</li>
<p>
<li>Do not fool a superior scammer: Trying to outscam an observant or smarter person will end in disaster.</li>
<P>
<li>Plan your escape from your scam: Lets say someone is suspicious. Don't burn your bridges and walk away. Save the source.</li>
<p>
<li>Try to be a woman: It's proven that women are more trusted over the phone. Use that to an advantage. Get a woman's help if needed. It's even better if you're actually a woman (a rareity in our biz).</li>
<p>
<li>Watermarks: Learn to make 'em. They are invaluable for a mail scam.</li>
<p>
<li>Business cards and fake names: Use them for professional things.</li>
<p>
<li>Manipulate the less fortunate and the stupid</li>
<p>
<li>Use a team if you have to: Don't be arrogant and overly proud. If you need help, get it</li>
