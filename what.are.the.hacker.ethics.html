What are the Hacker ethics?

   The best source on the subject is Stephen Levy's Hackers: Heroes of
   the Computer Revolution, Bantam books, 1984. There's a new 10th
   anniversary issue with a new afterword published in 1994.

    1. Access to computers-and anything which might teach you something
       about the way the world works-should be unlimited and total.
       Always yield to the Hands-On imperative!
    2. All information should be free.
    3. Mistrust Authority-Promote Decentralization.
    4. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such
       such degrees, age, race, or position.
    5. You can create art and beauty on a computer.
    6. Computers can change (your) life for the better.
