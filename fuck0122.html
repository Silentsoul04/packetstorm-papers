                             SummerCon '95
                               in review

Atlanta has a proud history in the hacking scene and was an obvious
choice to host SummerCon '95.  I lived in Atlanta a few years back and
was looking forward to getting together with old friends like Captain
Hemp, Bytor, Peyote Coyote, Blue Adept, Coup, Gonzo and Sniper.
Engineering a bit of time off from work and not totalling a car this
month was all it took to clear the way for a trip to SummerCon '95.

I arrived early Friday evening and ran into Johnny Oakley on the way to
the Clarion Hotel's bar, where I ended up spending a great deal of the
weekend.  Friday evening was spent meeting old friends (many of whom I
had never met) and making new ones.  Unlike DefCon, there were no name
tags.  The only way to spot people you knew was to approach everyone in
the hotel to identify themselves.  I am amazed at how shy most of
attendees were.  I went around shaking hands and collecting nicks until
I had greeted almost everyone at the convention.

Friday evening's fun was dampened by the first arrest of the convention.
Simurgh was caught in a hotel office and whisked off to a local jail.
Several others of us were detained momentarily, but nothing came of it.
Simurgh was charged with Criminal Trespass, Theft by Taking, and
Possession of Marijuana.  His weekend of fun ended early.

TeleMonster arrived early and set up a computer controlled light show on
the side of the hotel.  As con attendees checked in, he expanded the
light show to include more hotel windows(tm).  The con attendees took
great delight in the light show, though the hotel manager eventually
demanded that it be dismantled.

Vandalism seemed to be the theme of the convention this year.
Apparently, some conventioneers took the graphic on the SummerCon '95
T-Shirt just a bit too seriously.  Room number signs were stolen by the
dozen, the stairwell was flooded with water, exit signs were removed,
panels of wall paper where ripped down, the elevators were vandalized,
the phone room was broken into and many rooms lost phone service. I do
not have a financial stake either way, but I cannot help but wonder if
hacker conventions might not be a bit more fun if we did not have to
deal with hostile hotel staff.

The speakers were scheduled to begin at 10:00 Saturday.  Unfortunately,
I was just getting to bed at that time.  The speakers were mostly the
same folks who speak at every convention, so I stayed in bed for most of
them.  I got up for Strat's talk about the new TCP/IP implementations.
Although the speech was very good, the hi-light of it was an accusation
by an audience member that Strat had recently narced out a number of
well known (but curiously absent from the convention) members of the
hacking community.  Strat denied any knowledge of what the audience
member was discussing.

        10:00   Intro
        10:10   Robert Steele   -  Hackers from the Intelligence Perspective
        11:00   Eric Hughes     -  Cryptography, Banking and Commerce
        12:00   Annaliza Savage -  Unauthorized Access
         2:15   Video tape of a physical switch break-in
         3:00   Bob Stratton    -  The Future of TCP/IP Security
         4:00   Winn Schwartu   -  Electromagnetic Weaponry
         5:00   Chris Goggans   -  International Intrigue

Chris Goggans (Erik Bloodaxe) ended up with a speech asking people to
hack computers in foreign countries, and telling conventioneers that
prosecution for doing so is almost impossible.  Chris changed plans at
the last moment and did not attempt to hack in front of the audience.
One country mentioned in particular was France, which is vulnerable to
ypx attacks.  Expect transcontinental Internet connections to slow for
some time.

After the agenda was finished, it was back to the bar for more
socializing.  Unfortunately, one participant didn't make it back to the
bar, and was instead discovered unconscious in the phone closet.  The
hotel management was not impressed and Y is now facing charges of Public
Drunkenness, Trespassing, Obstructing Justice and Fighting Words.

Trashing runs were organized on Saturday and Sunday nights, including
one to the AT&T dumpster that Adam Grant (The Urvile) demonstrated on
NBC DateLine.  That particular journey yielded a COSMOS account.  Other
runs brought up a BBS for AT&T System 75 tech support and enough credit
card numbers to buy Miami.

I spent part of the convention with a group of conventioneers who
labelled themselves as "Dark Side Hackers."  Although they failed to
live up to the "Dark Side" portion of their name, they were a fun group
of people with a very impressive set of technical skills.  Where else
will you find good X.25 jokes... and people who laugh at them?  These
guys play hard, are good at what they do, but don't represent a danger
to Western Civilization.

Several people at the convention asked me how SummerCon '95 stacked up
against other cons I've attended.  I really liked SummerCon '95.  It
wasn't as organized or publicized as DefCon, but other than that it went
off very well.  I tend to rate cons based on who shows up, and
attendance was very good.

DefCon is coming up in less than two months, and HoHoCon in December.
DefCon is going to be in Las Vegas, but it is still plagued with cost
problems.  HoHoCon will most likely be either in Dallas or New Orleans,
both of which are excellent choices.  If ErikB doesn't run SummerCon '96
and no one else steps up to take charge, perhaps Dark Tangent will merge
the two conventions.  Either way, HoHoCon should continue to run well
under Drunkfux's leadership.

Here are a few of the people who attended SummerCon '95:  Albatross,
AliceD, Armitage, Asriel, BioHazard, Blue Adept, Buster Bunny, Bytor,
Captain Hemp, Carl Corey, Central Scrutinizer, Coup, Crimson Death,
