           We work in the dark
           We do what we can
           We give what we have
           Our doubt is our passion, and our passion is our task
           The rest is the madness of art.

                     -- Henry James

           When I picture a perfect reader, I always picture a
           monster of courage and curiosity, also something
           supple, cunning, cautious, a born adventurer and
           discoverer...

                     -- Friedreich Nietzsche
