* What are keyloggers ?

  A keylogger is a program, which logs everything you write with your
  computer. Your login names, passwords, documents, what you chat, ...
  Many implementations exist for linux and windows operating systems.


* How to circumvent it ?

  First of all, if you physically hack a computer, search for such
  keylogging software (If you have time for it). But what if you use
  a third party computer to login into your mail account ? It's possible to
  record your keystroke on this computer. What can you do to circumvent this ?
  The solution is cut and paste with your mouse. If you cut and paste chars,
  the keylogger cannot log your input. You can use letters (or words) from
  dialog boxes, documents or any other windows. If gpm is enabled in linux,
  you can use it to build your strings in a linux console. In MS Windows
  and X-Windows mouse is always activated. But what if you cannot find your
  letter (word) in the dialog-boxes, documents, ... The solution is easy.
  Launch notepad or vi and type (without '""'):

  "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-.,'#*..."

  This is only an example. Write down all possible chars, because if you
  only use the chars which you need for your password, it's easy to brute
  force your password. Now cut and paste letter by letter to your location
  (password field) and you circumvent the keylogger. Only one problem.
  The last character of your password is stored in the clipboard. Copy any
  other text. Now your last char is overwritten. If you use a network
  connection, this technic doesn't help, because the keystrokes are recorded
  by a network sniffers. You can use tools like cryptcat to circumvent
  this.

  It's only possible to use a virtual keyboard for your input. WinXP
  has such a tool and many other virtual keyboard application exist.
