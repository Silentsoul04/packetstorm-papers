<UL>I spent one morning looking at Yahoo's mail security  ...here's what I've found and how I did it.....<p><br>I created an account whilst dialed into Pipex. I logged out and closed my browser. On reopening the browser I pasted in the following URL:<p>ht

tp://mail.yahoo.com/py/ymTop.py?y=1<p>and this took me back to my account with out any error messages or prompts for a login. I then closed my browser, disconnected from Pipex and dialed <br>into Globalnet. When connected I opened my browser and pasted th

e same URL:<br>And was taken back to my mail-box! This made me think there must be a cookie controlling this...sure enough there it was. (1 of 3)<p>One, the user@mail.yahoo.com cookie in the rough looks like this :<p><br>YM.Login<br>id%3dreIvr96lzVC4g%26s

ious. I clicked on exit and checked the whole "exit" document. Down the bottom I found a link :<p>Log off completely.<p><br>Nice of them to warn you and put it way down the bottom. Most new users will not realise that the log off process is a double actio

n...if you log  off "completely" then the cookie is removed from the Temporay Internet Files directory.<p>What does all this mean ?<br>Security wise if you can get physical access to a machine that someone has used to collect their mail and not done the d

ouble log off then you can <br>access their account perhaps ad infinitum. (I don't know yet if the cookie  has a TTL so to speak.) In practice this means you'll be cracking a friend's,<br>work (or school) colleague's or family member's account. Good for s

nooping on your girlfriend's e-mail activities too.... <evil cackle>. Unfortunately<br>you can't copy it to a floppy disk and save it in your own computer's Temporary Internet Files directory because of the ":" ...What you'd need to do is copy it to a flo

ppy anyway...so you've got what info you need...then, now here's the complicated part :<p>Set your own PC up as a webserver as well as a DNS server (if you've got NT Server your laughing). Create a DNS entry for mail.yahoo.com and use the loopback (127.0.

0.1). Then create an htm file with the necessary script to impart a cookie with this same <br>information. Connect to mail.yahoo.com (you'll actually loopback) and the cookie will be downloaded to the Temp Net files Directory....<p>A big hassle to do...pr

obably easier to watch them type their password ;o) but it's knowing how it can be done..that's the important thing. Btw, just for any of you jokers out there...I've modified the security identifier and the e-mail account name etc....I'm not gonna give yo

u a copy of my real cookie then tell you how to exploit it...get real ;o) There'll be other ways to crack yahoo, of course....this is just my offering on the matter...for now anyway.<p>
