 
Calling all Makers, Hackers, Red Teams, Blue Teams, or anyone who wants to rant about security and privacy! The first ever BSides Knoxville is scheduled for May 15th, 2015 @ Scruffy City Hall, and we’re looking for creative, cutting-edge presentations.  Whether you’ve devised a new attack against internet-connected gas pumps or discovered a new behavioral analysis technique for identifying botnet C&C, we want to hear from you!  Attacking, defending, threat intelligence, privacy issues, reverse engineering, philosophy; if it has a security, hacking, or privacy angle, BSides Knoxville is interested!

If you want to shape Appalachia’s view on security, please submit a short abstract describing your contribution at:
