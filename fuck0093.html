                            Why The Scene is Lame
                            ---------------------

Why am I bringing this damned subject up in the first place?  Well, there are
a few (actually, QUITE a few) reasons why.  The scene is lame.  Not because
the 0-day isn't flowing, but for other reasons.  I'm gonna explain a few to
you, in laymens terms, and if you want to get into more detail, think about
it yourself, for I do not have enough time, nor enough patience to explain it
all myself.

Lets start with the basics, shall we?   First off, lets discuss this
damned Internet.  Or for you puds, The Information Superhighway.  What a load
of crap.  I remember when no one could get on, and it was barren, and only
the k-eleetest could get on.  Now it's a gathering place for puds from all
around the world, so you have to deal with thousands of puds from all over,
rather than the typical hundred or so in your area code (Who also have
Internet access, and are on there presently)...  [quote from a friend of
mine] 'There are alot of kids out there, who's parents are rich, and they
think internet is better than sex'..  Isn't that the damned truth.  I'm
getting sick of hearing about all the lame-asses that get access.  I dont'
have access presently, nor do I ever plan on it, because A) I'm not willing
to pay to be hanging out with a LARGE group of puds, asking for the zero-day,
and B) It's too lame.  Maybe if we could put each person who wants access
to a test, to see if they are truely lame, that would be cooler.  Most of the
problem lies in the attitudes of the stuck up brats that hang around there
with their 0-days.  That is one, and the other problem with attitudes is
the people that hang out in #ansi all day long, just asking if they could
do an ansi for someone, or asking for money to do an ansi for someone.
That's lamer than hell.  Who out there is truely into making money out of a
hobby, whoch you must be good at (I admit, ansi takes skill, especially you
ACiD d00ds, which we all love and adore).  Selling a peice of information,
which is just 1's and 0's, which really isn't REAL at all...  Anyone else
think this sounds a little lame?   Yes.  Why can't we limit it...  damn you
all in #ansi.

Another reason the scene is lame.  z3R0-d4Z3 d00d!!  Now we have a
large portion of people that do nothing but leech from their favorite TDT or
RAZOR board to courier to their bestest friends.  What the hell..  Heard a
comment not too long ago, that the reason he does it, is (and I quote) 'It's
easier than H/P'..  What the hell type of comment is that?  Go buy a mac and
sit all day in front of it playing pong, see if we miss you.  Easier?  Pishah!

Now a days, getting the zer0-daze is harder than it was a year ago.  The
security (which makes NO sense) is stricter, and no one has a sense of fucking
humor anymore.  They're all too damned uptight with their warez, they forget
about having a >grunt
