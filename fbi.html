<P>
<table width= 580>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE>
Here are some basic guidelines you should keep in mind when making Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the FBI:
<UL>
<LI>Send a copy of your request to the FBI field office in you area. Keep a copy for yourself. Call both to see if they received your requests.
<p>
<LI>If you are concerned about a specific incident or period of time, be as
detailed as possible in your request.
<p>
<LI>The FBI can deny a request on grounds that the information you seek is:
        <OL>
        <LI> Classified secret in the name of national defense or foreign policy.
        <LI> Only applicable to internal personnel rules and practices.

        <LI> Applicable to trade secrets or proprietary commercial information.

        <LI> Contained in personnel or medical files where disclosure would be an invasion of privacy.
        </OL>
</UL>

<P>
These are the main reasons. There a number of others, mostly pertaining to
interagency
communication. But, remember:

<UL>
An agency may not withhold an entire file because some of the
information it
contains is exempt from disclosure. An agency is not required to withhold
information.
Officials may only choose to do so under certain circumstances.

<P>
The agency must explain the reasons for denying your request. You have
the right
to appeal. Appeals must be answered within 20 working days.

<P>
If your appeal is turned down, you may take the agency to court.</B>
